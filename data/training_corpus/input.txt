1Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
CHAPTER ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,

because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she

spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the

neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their

opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't

think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.

Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;

in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her

sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was

possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy

was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want

Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the

country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for

work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming

Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
2because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got

into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to
look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet

Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking

of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and

stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the

corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now

reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of

nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in

funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this

was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering

wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite

close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was

enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man
had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some

silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...

yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.

Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate

on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad

daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed

open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never

seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly

normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made
several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs

and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
3He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't

know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering

excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on

his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he

caught a few words of what they were saying.
"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better

of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost

finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the

receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was

being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were

lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think
of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point

in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her

sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all

the same, those people in cloaks...
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that
he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It
was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a

violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in
a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,

for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at

last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,

happy day!"
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that

was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
4he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
didn't approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --
and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that

morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a
stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying

to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still

determined not to mention anything to his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had

learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When

Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to

catch the last report on the evening news:
"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally

hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been

hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since

sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly

changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin.

"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going
to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as

Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead

of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting
stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?

And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat

nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister

lately, have you?"
5As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
"No," she said sharply. "Why?"
"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting
stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.

"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you
know... her crowd."
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he

didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son --

he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"

"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."

"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite
agree."
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom

window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.

It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
something.
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of

-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting
thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were

involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.

Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about
6them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get
mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over

-- it couldn't affect them....
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat
on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as

still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of

Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the

next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly

midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the

ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which
were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,
a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.

His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon

spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been

broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to

realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,

which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For

some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and

muttered, "I should have known."
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and

clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He

clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times

he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street

were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed
Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening

down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his

cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down
7on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.
"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."

He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling
at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly
the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was

wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight

bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
"How did you know it was me?" she asked.
"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said
Professor McGonagall.
"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here."
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles

have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her
head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks
of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They

were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet

that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."
"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years."
"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no
reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on

the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,

swapping rumors."
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping
he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A

fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have

disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he
8really has gone, Dumbledore?"
"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful
for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"
"A what?""A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"
"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't
think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if

You-Know-Who has gone -"
"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him
by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I

have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:

Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was

unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so

confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason
to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.
"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're

the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."
"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will
never have."
"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."

"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
told me she liked my new earmuffs."
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls
are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what

everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally

stopped him?"
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard
wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed

Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that

whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until
9Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer.
"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is

that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...
Oh, Albus..."
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I
know..." he said heavily.
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all.
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he

couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,

but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's
power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.
Dumbledore nodded glumly.

"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's
done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?

It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the
name of heaven did Harry survive?"
"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving

around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because

he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was

he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"
"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to
tell me why you're here, of all places?"
"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family
he has left now."
10"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried
Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't

find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw

him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
Harry Potter come and live here!"
"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've

written them a letter."
"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a
letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a

legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day

in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child

in our world will know his name!"
"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his
half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous

before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even

remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away

from all that until he's ready to take it?"
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and
then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy
getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she

thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
"Hagrid's bringing him."
"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as
this?"
I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.

"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does
tend to -- what was that?"
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
11headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and
a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of

them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times
as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands

the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were

like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle

of blankets.
"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?"
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to

me. I've got him, sir."
"No problems, were there?"
"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right
before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was

flyin' over Bristol."
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a
tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously

shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall.
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever."
"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"

"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself
above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well

-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.
"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his
12great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a

wounded dog.
"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!"
"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead

-- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"
"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or
we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly

on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out
of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to

the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at

the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall

blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from

Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.
"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."
"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose

into the air and off into the night.
"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore,
nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and

twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet

Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking

around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the

bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish
of his cloak, he was gone.
13A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and
tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect

astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his

blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside

him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was

famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and

pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very

moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up

their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy

who lived!"
CHAPTER TWO
THE VANISHING GLASS

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at
all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass

number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living

room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when

Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the

photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.

Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a
large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large

blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a

computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.

The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made

the first noise of the day.
"Up! Get up! Now!"

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then
the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his

back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a
14good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny
feeling he'd had the same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door.

"Are you up yet?" she demanded.
"Nearly," said Harry.
"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you
dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."
Harry groaned.
"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door.
"Nothing, nothing..."

Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out
of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,
after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to

spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and

that was where he slept.
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as
though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a

racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated

exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's

favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry

didn't look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and

skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes

of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry

had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He

wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry
liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that

was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could

remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
15Petunia was how he had gotten it.
"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
questions."
Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Dursleys.
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.

"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts
than the rest of the boys in his class put
together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --
all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,

not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay

smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley

looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a

pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult
as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.

His face fell.
"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two
less than last year."
"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here
under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down

his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's

that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''
16Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."
"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.
"Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right
then."
Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like
his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a
video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and

a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia

came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't
take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction.
Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every
year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the

day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every

year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two

streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage
and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever
owned.
"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd
planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had

broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be
a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
Tufty again.
"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.

"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't
there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't

understand them, like a slug.
17"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"
"On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia.

"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go
on Dudley's computer).
Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.

"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled.

"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening.
"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
and leave him in the car...."
"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had
been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up

his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.
"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special
day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him.
"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge,
pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty

grin through the gap in his mother's arms.
Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt
Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers
Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face
like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their

backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in
the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the

zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able
to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle
Vernon had taken Harry aside.
"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up
18close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,
anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until

Christmas."
"I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was
just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which
she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly

at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,

where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.

Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it

had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he
couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she

tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until

finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to
his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.
On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as

usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was
sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school

buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon

through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash

cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have

caught him in mid- jump.
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with
Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,

his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.
19While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the

bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,

it was motorcycles.
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a
motorcycle overtook them.
I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It
was flying."
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet
with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"
Dudley and Piers sniggered.

I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream."
But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking

about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a

dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous

ideas.
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The
Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the
entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry

what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap

lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they

watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,

except that it wasn't blond.
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to
walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who

were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall

back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo

restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker

glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to
last.
20After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in
there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts

of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and

stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,

man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car
and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in

the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the
glistening brown coils.
"Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the
glass, but the snake didn't budge.
"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He
wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no

company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying

to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a

bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised
its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.
It winked.
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised
its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:
"I get that all the time.
"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the
snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."
21The snake nodded vigorously.
"Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked.

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
peered at it.
Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

"Was it nice there?"

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:
This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to
Brazil?"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of
them jump.
"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU
WON'T BELIEVE

WHAT IT'S DOING!"
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.

"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by
surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were

leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with

howls of horror.
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank
had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering
out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and

started running for the exits.
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,
hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
22The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea
while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only

gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except

snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were

all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had

nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers
calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you,

Harry?"
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to

say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a
chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He
didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were

asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen

for some food.
He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as
long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents

had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when

his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long

hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding

flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he
supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green
light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and

uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask

questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown
relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)

that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers

they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once

while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry

furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the

shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long
purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and

then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these

people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a
23closer look.
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated
that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and

nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.
CHAPTER THREE
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE

The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard
again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time

out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet

Drive on her crutches.
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,
who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and
Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and

stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite

happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,
wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he
could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off
to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be

with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private

school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the

other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley

thought this was very funny.
"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,"
he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?"
"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as
horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before

Dudley could work out what he'd said.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings
uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as

usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,
24and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch
television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though

she'd had it for several years.
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in
his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange
knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't

looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said
gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst

into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He
thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to

laugh.
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in
the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like
dirty rags swimming in gray water.
"What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always
did if he dared to ask a question.
"Your new school uniform," she said.
Harry looked in the bowl again.
"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet."

"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old
things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've
finished."
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat
down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look

on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old

elephant skin, probably.
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the
smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as

usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,
25on the table.
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
doormat.
"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.
"Make Harry get it."
"Get the mail, Harry."

"Make Dudley get it."
"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley."
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things
lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was

vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a

bill, and -- a letter for Harry.
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant
elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who

would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the

library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet

here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
Mr. H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs

4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the
address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.
Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax
seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake

surrounding a large letter H.
26"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you
doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke.
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed
Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to

open the yellow envelope.
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over
the postcard.
"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --."

"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!"
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the
same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of

his hand by Uncle Vernon.
"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
"Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open
with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster

than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds

it was the grayish white of old porridge.
"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped.
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it
high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first

line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her

throat and made a choking noise.
"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!"
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He

gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.
"I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said
Harry furiously, "as it's mine."
"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back
inside its envelope.
27Harry didn't move.
I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted.

"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley.
"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the
scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the

kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but

silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,

his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at

the crack between door and floor.
"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the
address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think

they're watching the house?"
"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon
wildly.
"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't
want --"
Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the
kitchen.
"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an
answer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything....
"But --""I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took
him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd
never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed
through the door. "Who's writing to me?"
"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly.
"I have burned it."
28"It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it."
"SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the
ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a

smile, which looked quite painful.
"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been
thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might

be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.
"Why?" said Harry.
"Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuff upstairs,
now."
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt
Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one

where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things
that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip
upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He

sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was

broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working

tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the

corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot

through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school
for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent

because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They

were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been

touched.
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't
want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...."
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given
anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with

that letter than up here without it.
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in
shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been

sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the

greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was
29thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the
letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each

other darkly.
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice
to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with
his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's
another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'"
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the
hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the

ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact

that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a
minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with

Harry's letter clutched in his hand.
"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry.
"Dudley -- go -- just go."
Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out
of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first

letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure

they didn't fail. He had a plan.
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry
turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the
Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and
get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept

across the dark hall toward the front door --
Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on
the doormat -- something alive!
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the
big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been

lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making
sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He
shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make

a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the

time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
30Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.
I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into
pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He

stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if
they can't deliver them they'll just give up."
"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."

"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not
like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the
piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they
couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,

slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small

window in the downstairs bathroom.
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got
out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and

back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"

as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to
Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each
of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt

Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious

telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone

to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.
"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in
amazement.
On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking
tired and rather ill, but happy.
"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade
on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --"
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught
him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty
31letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.
"Out! OUT!"
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their
faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters

still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling
great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back

here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some
clothes. No arguments!"
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared
argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the

boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.

Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the
head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and
computer in his sports bag.
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they
were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and

drive in the opposite direction for a while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em

off," he would mutter whenever he did this.
They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd

missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone

so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the
outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds

and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on

the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and

wondering....
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the
hotel came over to their table.
"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred
32of these at the front desk."
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:

Mr. H. Potter
Room 17
Railview Hotel

Cokeworth

Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out
of the way. The woman stared.
"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following
her from the dining room.
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested
timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly
what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the

middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in

the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle

of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of

a multilevel parking garage.
"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that
afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside

the car, and disappeared.
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley
sniveled."It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I
want to stay somewhere with a television. "
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you
could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of

television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of
course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys
had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

Still, you weren't eleven every day.
33Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,
thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd

bought.
"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!"
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what
looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was

the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was

certain, there was no television in there.
"Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his
hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his
boat!"
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather
wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below

them.
"I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!"
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like

hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,

led the way to the broken-down house.
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind
whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was

damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four
bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
and shriveled up.
"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully.

He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance
of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately

agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the
high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the

filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second
34room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle
Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find

the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,

most ragged blanket.
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry
couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,
his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the

low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of

Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat

wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and

watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would

remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the
roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.

Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of

letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like
that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was

the rock crumbling into the sea?
One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...
nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...

one...
BOOM.The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the
door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.
CHAPTER FOURTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS

BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Where's the cannon?" he
said stupidly.
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the
room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been

in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
35"Who's there?" he shouted. "I warn you -- I'm armed!"
There was a pause. Then --

SMASH!The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and
with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost
completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled

beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles
under all the hair.
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just
brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it

easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a

little. He turned to look at them all.
"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy
journey..."
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.

"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger.
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
"An' here's Harry!" said the giant.
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the
beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant. "Yeh look a
lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
I demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said. "You are breaking and
entering!"
36"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over
the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent

it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it

into a corner of the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
"Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on

it at some point, but it'll taste all right."
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in
green icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words
got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are

you?"
The giant chuckled.
"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts."
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.
"What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together.
"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind."
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and
he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he
was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire
there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt

the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a

copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several
chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from
before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and

smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was

working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt
37sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said
sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."
The giant chuckled darkly.

"Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'
worry."
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the

giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,

"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are."
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand.
"Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm
Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.
"Er -- no," said Harry.
Hagrid looked shocked.

"Sorry," Harry said quickly.

"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back
into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't
gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou'

Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents

learned it all?"
"All what?" asked Harry.
"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!"
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
"Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy --
this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?"
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after
all, and his marks weren't bad.
38"I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff." But
Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your

world. My world. Yer parents' world."
"What world?"
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
"DURSLEY!" he boomed.

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded
like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're
famous. You're famous."
"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?"
"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
"Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the
boy anything!"
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled

with rage.
"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore
left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'

you've kept it from him all these years?"
"Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly.
"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
39"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a
wizard."
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind
could be heard.
"-- a what?" gasped Harry.
"A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which
groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once

yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else

would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,

The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all

necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress

Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't
decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does
it mean, they await my owl?"
"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to
his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet
40another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,
rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.

With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could

read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.

Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its
beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he

came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the

telephone.
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
"Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still
ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
"He's not going," he said.
Hagrid grunted.
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said.

"A what?" said Harry, interested.
"A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I

ever laid eyes on."
"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said
Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!"
"You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm a -- a wizard?"
"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of course we knew! How
41could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a
letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came

home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups

into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!

But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,

they were proud of having a witch in the family!"
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed
she had been wanting to say all this for years.
"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and
had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange,

just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up and we got landed with you!"
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown
up? You told me they died in a car crash!"
"CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys
scuttled back to their corner. "How could a car crash kill Lily an'
James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his

own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" "But why? What

happened?" Harry asked urgently.
The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.
"I never expected this," he said, in a low, worried voice. "I had no
idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of

yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right

person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter

Hogwarts not knowin'."
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't
tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It
begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible
yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"
"Who? "
42"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."
"Why not?"

"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is
difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you
could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..."
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.

"Could you write it down?" Harry suggested.

"Nah -can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don'
make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years
ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were

afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin'

himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust,

didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible

things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him --
an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was
Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.

Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.
Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why

You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew
they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the
Dark Side.
"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em
outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where

you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old.
He came ter yer house an' -- an' --"
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew
his nose with a sound like a foghorn.
"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer
people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."
"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of
the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of

it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't
43do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no
ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches

yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't

work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after

he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the

best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the
Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived."
Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story
came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more

clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered

something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel

laugh.
Hagrid was watching him sadly.
"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought
yeh ter this lot..."
"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to

have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were

clenched.
"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something
strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured
-- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no
denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion --

asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types --

just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink
umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a
sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more

word... "
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,
Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the

wall and fell silent.
"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on
the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
44Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?"

"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter
kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see...
he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?
"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough
human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his

time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back

ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they

could've done if he was comin' back.
"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.
Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry.

There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno

what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all

right."
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but
Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had

been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd

spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and

Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned

into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If
he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley
had always been able to kick him around like a football?
"Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made a mistake. I
don't think I can be a wizard."
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or
angry?"
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd
thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's
gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going

to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow

back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his
45revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa
constrictor on him?
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively
beaming at him.
"See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be
right famous at Hogwarts."
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.

"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall
High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs
all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --"
"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled
Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.

His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest

school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he
won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a
change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had

Albus Dumbled--"
"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM
MAGIC TRICKS!"
yelled Uncle Vernon.
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled
it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE-

IN- FRONT- OF- ME!"He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley
-- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a
sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with

his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned

his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in

his trousers.
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other
room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door
behind them.
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
46"Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work
anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like

a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do."
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he
said. "I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was

allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff

-- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job
"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry.
"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter
tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an'

everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,

Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled?"
"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow," said Hagrid
loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.

"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I
think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets."
CHAPTER FIVEDIAGON ALLEY
Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called
Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open

my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard."
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart
sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good
47dream.
Tap. Tap. Tap.

"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up."
He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of
sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed

sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper

held in its beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon
was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it
open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who
didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to

attack Hagrid's coat.
"Don't do that."
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak
fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl

"Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
"What?"
"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets."
Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of

keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...

finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.
"Knuts?"

"The little bronze ones."
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg
so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then

he flew off through the open window.
48Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy
all yer stuff fer school."
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just
thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon
inside him had got a puncture.
"Um -- Hagrid?"

"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he
won't pay for me to go and learn magic."
"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his
head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
"But if their house was destroyed --"
"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is
Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I

wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."
"Wizards have banks?"
"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

"Goblins?"
"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never
mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer

anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o'

fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts

business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do

important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --
knows he can trust me, see.
"Got everythin'? Come on, then."
49Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and
the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was

still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
"Flew," said Hagrid.
"Flew?"
"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've
got yeh."
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to
imagine him flying.
"Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of
his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would

yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"
"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out
the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and

they sped off toward land.
"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked.

"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he
spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And
then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under

London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter

get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat."
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the
Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never

had so many questions in his life.
"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning
the page.
"There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop
himself.
"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '
50course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls

every morning, askin' fer advice."
"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"
"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still
witches an' wizards up an' down the country."
"Why?"

"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their
problems. Nah, we're best left alone."
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the

street.
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town
to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as
tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like

parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles

dream up, eh?"
"Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say
there are dragons at Gringotts?"
"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon."
"You'd like one?"

"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go."
They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five
minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he

called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and
sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.
"Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry
took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
51"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything yeh need."
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night
before, and read:

BROOMSTICKS"Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered aloud.
"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.

Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know
where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an
ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and

complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they
climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined

with shops.
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do
was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,

hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it

could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of

ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles
beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and
broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had

cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of

humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything

Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help

trusting him.
"This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a
famous place."
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,
53Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the

record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at

all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and

Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered

him inside.
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were
sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was

smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old

bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The

low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know

Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a
glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"
"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great
hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.
"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this
be --?"
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
"Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an
honor."
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his
hand, tears in his eyes.
"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old
woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.

Hagrid was beaming.
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry
found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.
"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."
54"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter."
"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus
Diggle."
"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off
in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."
"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did
you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again --

Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.
A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes
was twitching.
"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
one of your teachers at Hogwarts."
"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,
"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you."
"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?"

"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as
though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh,
P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your
equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,

m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought.
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It
took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid
managed to make himself heard over the babble.
"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry."

Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was

nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell
55was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'."
"Is he always that nervous?"

"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was
studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there

was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.

Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me

umbrella?"
Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was
counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
"Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry."

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a
small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they

were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a

cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."
He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry
looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly

back into solid wall.
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring
-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money
first."Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every
direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at
once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as

they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're

mad...."
56A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl
Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of

about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with

broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus

Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops
selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen
before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,

tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion

bottles, globes of the moon....
"Gringotts," said Hagrid.
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other
little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a

uniform of scarlet and gold, was -
"Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white
stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very
long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were

facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved

upon them:
Enter, stranger, but take heed
Of what awaits the sin of greed,
For those who take, but do not earn,

Must pay most dearly in their turn.
So if you seek beneath our floors
A treasure that was never yours,

Thief, you have been warned, beware

Of finding more than treasure there.
"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid.
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a
57vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high
stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing

coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.

There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more

goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made

for the counter.
"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money
outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."
"You have his key, Sir?"

"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits
over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry

watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as

glowing coals.
"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
The goblin looked at it closely.
"That seems to be in order."

"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in
vault seven hundred and thirteen."
The goblin read the letter carefully.

"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone
take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward

one of the doors leading off the hall.
"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry
asked."Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh

that."
58Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more
marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with

flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little

railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came

hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some
difficulty -- and were off.
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry
tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,

but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,

because Griphook wasn't steering.
Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them
wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a

passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -

they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge

stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,
"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"
"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions
just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small
door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the
wall to stop his knees from trembling.
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and
as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns

of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
"All yours," smiled Hagrid.
All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about
this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had

they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there

had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.
"The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to
59a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,
that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe

for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,

please, and can we go more slowly?"
"One speed only," said Griphook.
They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became
colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went

rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to

try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and

pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with
one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through
the door and trapped in there," said Griphook.
"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked.

"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,
Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous
jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then

he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on

the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry

longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.
"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way
back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid.
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag

full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a

pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole
life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.
"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam
Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I
60slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam

Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot
here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. "
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on
a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam

Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his

head, and began to pin it to the right length.
"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?"
"Yes," said Harry.

"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street
looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then
I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why

first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting

me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.
"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on.
"No," said Harry.

"Play Quidditch at all?"
"No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my
house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"
"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know
I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in

Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing

he could say something a bit more interesting.
61"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the
front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing

at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
"He works at Hogwarts."
"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't
he?"
"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the
school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,

and ends up setting fire to his bed."
"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.
"Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?"
"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into
the matter with this boy.
"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were
our kind, weren't they?"
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."

"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're
just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some
of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,

imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.

What's your surname, anyway?"
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my
dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,
hopped down from the footstool.
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.
62Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him
(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
"What's up?" said Hagrid.

"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry
cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you
wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"
"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
about Quidditch!"
"Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate
boy in Madam Malkin's.
"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed
in."
"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown
up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what
everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what

does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones

with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look

what she had fer a sister!"
"So what is Quidditch?"
"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle
world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on

broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."

"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"
"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'
duffers, but --"
"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily.

"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
You-Know-Who was one."
"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"
63"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid.
They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as

paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in

covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with
nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have
been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag

Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and

Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,

Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley."
"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the
Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An'

anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more

study before yeh get ter that level."
Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says
pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing

potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited

the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible

smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff

stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined

the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung
from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself

examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,

glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.
"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday
present."
Harry felt himself go red.

"You don't have to --"
"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad,
toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'

like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want
64owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'."
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been
dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now

carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with

her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer

wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."
A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay

on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair
that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had

entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that

had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow

boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of

his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle

with some secret magic.
"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly

off the spindly chair.
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like
moons through the gloom of the shop.
"Hello," said Harry awkwardly.

"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.
Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It

seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm
work."
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those
65silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.
Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I

say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the

wizard, of course."
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to
nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
"And that's where..."

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a
long, white finger.
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly.
"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in

the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into

the world to do...."
He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.
"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid.
"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
"Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still
got the pieces, though," he added brightly.
"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
"Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now
-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver
markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?"
"Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry.
66"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to
finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round

his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of

a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix

tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands
are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite
the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with

another wizard's wand."
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was

flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
"That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on
the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon

heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a

wave."
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.
Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.
"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --"

Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was
snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
Go on, go on, try it out."
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting
for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the
shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here
somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --

holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised
the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air

and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,

throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
67clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very
good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "
He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,
still muttering, "Curious... curious..
"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.

"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It
so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave

another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave
you that scar."
Harry swallowed.

"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things
happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect
great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-

Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."
Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his

shop.
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through

the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked

down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at

them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped
packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up
another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized

where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.
"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said.

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat
them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.
"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid.
68Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of
his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the

words.
"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those people in the
Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know
anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm
famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what

happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he
wore a very kind smile.
"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the
beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's

hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a

great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact."
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.
"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross
-- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a

letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,

Harry."
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against

the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.
CHAPTER SIXTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so
scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia

and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do

anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry
in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did

become a bit depressing after a while.
69Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to
call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school

books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the

night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It

was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because

Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to
sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
to the wall, counting down to September the first.
On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and
uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went

down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on

television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and
Dudley screamed and ran from the room.
"Er -- Uncle Vernon?"

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.
"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."
Uncle Vernon grunted again.

"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
"Thank you."
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.

"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got
punctures, have they?"
Harry didn't say anything.

"Where is this school, anyway?"

"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven
o'clock," he read.
70His aunt and uncle stared.
"Platform what?"

"Nine and three-quarters."
"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and
three-quarters."
"It's on my ticket."

"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see.
You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up
to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother."
"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things
friendly.
"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that
ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings."
Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and
nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because

he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd

change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure
he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her
cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two

hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the

Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to

Harry, and they had set off.
They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought

this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the

platforms with a nasty grin on his face.
"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it
yet, do they?"
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over
one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and
71in the middle, nothing at all.
"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He
left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.

All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on

earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny
looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.
He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and
three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry

couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to

get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting

desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but
the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away,
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.

According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes

left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he

was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly

lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like
tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He

wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket

inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a
few words of what they were saying.
"-- packed with Muggles, of course --"

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four
boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like
Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so
did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
"Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.
"Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was
holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... "
"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go
72first."What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as

the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large

crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
"Fred, you next," the plump woman said.

"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call
yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?"
"Sorry, George, dear."
"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called
after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,

he had gone -- but how had he done it?
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.
There was nothing else for it.

"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman.
"Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and
gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to
--""How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.

"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight at the
barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared

you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a
run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron."
"Er -- okay," said Harry.
73He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very
solid.
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash

right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward
on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer
and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control

-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --
It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet
steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign

overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him
and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,
while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls

hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
the scraping of heavy trunks.
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.

Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.

He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad

again."
"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.

"Give us a look, Lee, go on."
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him
shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment
near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started

to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
painfully on his foot.
"Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through
74the barrier.
"Yes, please," Harry panted.

"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"
With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner
of the compartment.
"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.

"What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's
lightning scar.
"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you
"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry.

"What?" said Harry.
"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins.
"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am."

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to
his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.
"Fred? George? Are you there?"
"Coming, Mom."

With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the
red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their

mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
"Ron, you've got something on your nose."
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and
began rubbing the end of his nose.
"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free.
75"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the
twins.
"Shut up," said Ron.
"Where's Percy?" said their mother.
"He's coming now."

The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his
billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge

on his chest with the letter P on it.
"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got
two compartments to themselves --"
"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of
great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."
"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the
other twin. "Once --"
"Or twice --"

"A minute --"
"All summer --"
"Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect.

"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins.
"Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear,
well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there."
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.

"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl
telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"
"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet."
76"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."
"It's not funny. And look after Ron."

"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."
"Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already
and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.
"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who
he is?"
"Who?"

"Harry Potter!"
Harry heard the little girl's voice.
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...."

"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you
goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?"
"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning."
"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite
when he asked how to get onto the platform."
"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
like?"
Their mother suddenly became very stern.

"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs
reminding of that on his first day at school."
"All right, keep your hair on."
A whistle sounded.
77"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the
train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and

their younger sister began to cry.
"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."
"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."
"George!"

"Only joking, Mom."
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their
sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train

until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of
excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better
than what he was leaving behind.
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
came in.
"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.
"Everywhere else is full."
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then
looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw

he still had a black mark on his nose.
"Hey, Ron."
The twins were back.

"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a
giant tarantula down there."
"Right," mumbled Ron.
"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and
George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.
78"Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut
behind them.
"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.
Harry nodded.
"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said
Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..."
He pointed at Harry's forehead.
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.
"So that's where You-Know-Who

"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."
"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.
"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."

"Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as
though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out

of the window again.
"Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
"Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin
who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
"So you must know loads of magic already."
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale
boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.
"I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?"
"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."
79"Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up

to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie

was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess

around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks

they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,
but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get
anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes,

Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was
asleep."His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy
got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff

-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he
went back to staring out of the window.
Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to
afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a

month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old

clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer

Ron up."... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"
Ron gasped.

"What?" said Harry.
"You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and
impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people --"
"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I
just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to

learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that
had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class."
"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and
they learn quick enough."
80While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were

quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
"Anything off the cart, dears?"
Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears
went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went

out into the corridor.
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he
had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many

Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What

she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best

Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice

Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his
life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped
it onto an empty seat.
"Hungry, are you?"
"Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always

forgets I don't like corned beef."
"Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --"
"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much
time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us."
"Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share
before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,

cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
81"What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
"They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that

nothing would surprise him.
"No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."
"What?"
"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside
them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about

five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a
man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and
flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the

name Albus Dumbledore.
"So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry.
"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a
frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks
Harry turned over his card and read:

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is
particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in

1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his

work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore
enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that
Dumbledore's face had disappeared.
"He's gone!""Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. "He'll be
back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you

want it? You can start collecting."
82Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
unwrapped.
"Help yourself," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people
just stay put in photos."
"Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!"
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and
gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than

looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep

his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but

Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was
scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
"You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say
every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the

ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-
flavored one once."
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a
corner.
"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts."
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,
coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was

even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't

touch, which turned out to be pepper.
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat
fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green

hills.
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced
boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He

looked tearful.
"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"
When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting
83away from me!"
"He'll turn up," said Harry.

"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..."
He left.
"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd
lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't

talk."
The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.
"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in
disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more

interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking
wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the
end."Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway

He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again.
The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was
already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy
sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.
"We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl
wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.
"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."

She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

"Er -- all right."He cleared his throat.
"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."
84He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast
asleep."Are you sure that's a real spell?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very
good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's
all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such
a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I

mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard --

I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it

will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.
She said all this very fast.
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he
hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.
"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered.
"Harry Potter," said Harry.
"Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I
got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern

Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great

Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.
"Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed.
"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it
was me," said Hermione. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in?

I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far

the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw
wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's
toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there

soon."
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he
knew it was a dud."
"What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry.
85"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom
and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I

don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in

Slytherin."
"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"
"Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. "So what do your

oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.
"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing
something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about
Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you
get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security

vault."
Harry stared.

"Really? What happened to them?"
"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My
dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,

but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course,

everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case

You-Know-Who's behind it."
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a
prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this

was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more

comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying.
"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked.
"Er -- I don't know any," Harry confessed.
"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the
86world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to

with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the

money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game

when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the

toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with

a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.
"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry
Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"
"Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale

boy, they looked like bodyguards.
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly,
noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.
"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than
they can afford."
He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families
are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends

with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said
coolly.
Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale
cheeks.
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a
bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know

what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the
87Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
Both Harry and Ron stood up.

"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.
"Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because
Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food
and you still seem to have some."
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt
forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a

horrible yell.
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk
deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung
Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off

and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they

thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd

heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
"What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the
floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at
Scabbers. "No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-"
And so he had.
"You've met Malfoy before?"
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.

"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the
first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said
they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's
father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned to

Hermione. "Can we help you with something?"
88"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the
front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't

been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"
"Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would
you mind leaving while we change?"
"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving
very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a

sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you

know?"
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was
getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple
sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.
Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath

them.
A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five
minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken

to the school separately."
Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under
his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and
joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way
toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in

the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the

students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years
over here! All right there, Harry?"
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'
years follow me!"
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a
steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry

thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the

boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.
89"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over
his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."
There was a loud "Oooooh!"
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in

the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little
boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed

into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid,
who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!"
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the
lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at

the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer

and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they
all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain

of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried

along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the

castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they

clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the
boats as people climbed out of them.
"Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they
clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at
last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak
front door.
"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?"
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle
door.
90CHAPTER SEVEN
THE SORTING HAT

The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green
robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought
was that this was not someone to cross.
"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.

"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have
fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit
with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too

high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to

the upper floors.
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry
could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right
-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall

showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They

crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have

done, peering about nervously.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very

important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be

something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with

the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free

time in your house common room.
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced

outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your

triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose

house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is

awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a
credit to whichever house becomes yours.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the
rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as
91you can while you are waiting."
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to

flatten his hair.
"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall.
"Please wait quietly."
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.

"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron.
"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he
was joking."
Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole
school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have

to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,
too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering

very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one

she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more

nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to

the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He

kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall
would come back and lead him to his doom.
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --
several people behind him screamed.
"What the --?"
He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just
streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,

they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing

at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat

little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him

a second chance --"
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He
gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I

say, what are you all doing here?"
92A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
Nobody answered.

"New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be
Sorted, I suppose?"
A few people nodded mutely.

"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you
know."
"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to
start."
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away
through the opposite wall.
"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and
follow me."
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line
behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out

of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors

into the Great Hall.
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was
lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair

over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.

These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the

top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a
halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.

The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the

flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the

ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry

looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He

heard
Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read
about it in Hogwarts, A History."
93It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the
Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed
a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she

put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,
that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was

now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there

was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened

wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
But don't judge on what you see,

I'll eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me.
You can keep your bowlers black,

Your top hats sleek and tall,
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.

There's nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can't see,
So try me on and I will tell you

Where you ought to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;
94You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,

Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
if you've a ready mind,

Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin

You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.

So put me on! Don't be afraid!

And don't get in a flap!
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"

The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It
bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
"So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll
kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."
Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than
having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on
without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;
Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If

only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,

that would have been the one for him.
95Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
parchment.
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to
be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the
hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause

--"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at
the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving

merrily at her.
"Bones, Susan!"
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next
to Hannah.
"Boot, Terry!"

"RAVENCLAW!"
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws
stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender"
became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded

with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.
"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's
imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they

looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick

now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.

He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but

because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"
"HUFFLEPUFF!"96Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at
others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the

sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost

a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
"Granger, Hermione!"
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.

"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when
you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just
sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor

McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a

mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,
he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide
with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off

still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it

to "MacDougal, Morag."
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at
once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!"
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with
himself.
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a
pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and
then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little
hissing fires all over the hall.
"Potter, did she say?"
The Harry Potter?"
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the
hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he
97was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty
of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness,

yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....

So where shall I put you?"
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you

on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure
-- better be GRYFFINDOR!"
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off
the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so

relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed

that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and
shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got
Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff

he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,

horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,
sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd

gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair

was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the

ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man

from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple
turban.
And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean,"
a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.

"Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was

pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a

second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next
to him.
98"Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry
as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled

up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how
hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students,
his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to

see them all there.
"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin
our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!
Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
"Thank you!"

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know
whether to laugh or not.
"Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly.
"Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But
he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"
Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with
food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon

and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,

peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint

humbugs.
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been
allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything

that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his

plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.

It was all delicious.
"That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry
cut up his steak,
"Can't you --?"
99I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't
need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced

myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost

of Gryffindor Tower."
"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you
-- you're Nearly Headless Nick!"
"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't
going at all the way he wanted.
"Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His
whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on

a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it
properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly
Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,

"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house

championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without

winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody

Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained

with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to

see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest.
"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food
faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment

later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you

could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam
doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their
families.
100"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell
him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock

for him."
The others laughed.
"What about you, Neville?" said Ron.
"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the
family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept

trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he

pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but
nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for
dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles

when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let

go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They

were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you

should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might
not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased
he bought me my toad."
On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about
lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm

particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something

into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-";
"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of
thing -- ").
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at

the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy

black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's
turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across

the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head.
"What is it?" asked Percy.
101"N-nothing."
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he

didn't like Harry at all.
"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.
"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so
nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want

to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about

the Dark Arts, Snape."
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to
his feet again. The hall fell silent.
"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to
all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember

that as well."
Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
twins.
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all
that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor
on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to

die a very painful death."
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
"He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy.
102"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he
usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the

forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he

might have told us prefects, at least."
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried
Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become
rather fixed.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose

high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"
And the school bellowed:
"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,

Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,

Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,

Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us things worth knowing,
Bring back what we've forgot,

just do your best, we'll do the rest,

And learn until our brains all rot.
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the
Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.

Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they
103had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!
And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,
out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were
like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He

was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits

along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice

Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging

tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their

feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when
they came to a sudden halt.
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as
Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised
his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself"
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.

"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide
mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking
sticks.
"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.
"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked
Percy.
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on
Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as

he passed.
"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again.
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even

listen to us prefects. Here we are."
104At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress.
"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait
swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled
through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the
Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were

obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five

four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had
already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their
pajamas and fell into bed.
" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."
Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he
fell asleep almost at once.
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange
dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to

him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was

his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened
painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with

it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh

became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,

sweating and shaking.
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he
didn't remember the dream at all.
CHAPTER EIGHT
THE POTIONS MASTER
There, look.""Where?"
105"Next to the tall kid with the red hair."
"Wearing the glasses?"

"Did you see his face?"
"Did you see his scar?"
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look

at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.

Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on
finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different

on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to

remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you
asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors
that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It

was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed

to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit

each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of
them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right

direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a

trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would

drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,

pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab
your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus
Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their

very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a

door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds

corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was
sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening
to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor

Quirrell, who was passing.
106Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature
with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the

corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of

line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds

later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than

anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly
as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest
ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes
themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,

than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the

movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the

greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little

witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of

all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only
one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old
indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got
up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on

and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the
Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had
to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their

first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he

gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a

talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class
will leave and not come back. You have been warned."
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they
107weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match

and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,

only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor

McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and

gave Hermione a rare smile.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of

a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said

was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be

coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had

been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of
a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell

had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about

the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung

around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed

full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone
else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't

had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to

learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to
find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost
once."What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.
"Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of
Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see

if it's true."
"Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head
of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge

pile of homework the day before.
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but
it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a

hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,
108circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters
and packages onto their laps.
Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to
nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the

owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered
down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto
Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy

scrawl:
Dear Harry,
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have
a cup of tea with me around three?
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
Hedwig.
Hagrid
Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the
back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because
the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to
him so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor
Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd

been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder
here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough

without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity."
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their
109hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His
eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.

They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but
they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught
every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a

class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving

here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you

will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with

its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through

human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach
you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks
with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and

looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered
root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who
looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.
"I don't know, sit," said Harry.
Snape's lips curled into a sneer.

"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything."
He ignored Hermione's hand.
"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me
a bezoar?"
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without
her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were
shaking with laughter.
"I don't know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming,
110eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those
cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did

Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs

and Fungi?
Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon
ceiling."I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why
don't you try her?"
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.
Snape, however, was not pleased.
"Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter,
asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach

of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and

wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of

aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,
Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your
cheek, Potter."
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a

simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing
almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just

telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned

slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the

dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a

twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,

burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was
standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the
potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils

sprang up all over his arms and legs.
111"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one
wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before

taking the cauldron off the fire?"
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought
he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another

point you've lost for Gryffindor."
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked
him behind their cauldron.
"Doi* push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind
was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor
in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up,"

said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come

and meet Hagrid with you?"
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the
front door.
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and
several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang

-- back."
Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door
open.
"Hang on," he said. "Back, Fang."

He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous
black boarhound.
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the
ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner
112stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded
straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was

clearly not as fierce as he looked.
"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a
large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
"Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent
half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their
teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's

knee and drooled all over his robes.
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang
sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me

everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not
to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.
"But he seemed to really hate me."
"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?"

Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes
when he said that.
"How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot --
great with animals."
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron
told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a

piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a
cutting from the Daily Prophet:
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
113Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,
widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault
that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if
you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this

afternoon.
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to
rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.
"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
It might've been happening while we were there!"
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes
this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the

story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and
thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little

package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets
weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry

thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much
to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package
just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about

Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?
CHAPTER NINETHE MIDNIGHT DUEL
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,
but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.Still, first-year

Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to

put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a
notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and

Slytherinwould be learning together.
114"Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool
of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy."
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said Ron
reasonably. "Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he
is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk."
Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about
first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,

boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping

Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus
Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen

about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.

Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron

had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their

dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game
with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron
prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the

players move.
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had

good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of
accidents even with both feet on the ground.
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This
was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she

hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with

flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through
the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for
anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but

everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted

by the arrival of the mail.
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that
Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was
always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened
gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He
115opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large
marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things -- this
tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it

tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,
"You've forgotten something..."

Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy,
who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his

hand.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason
to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble

quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
"What's going on?"
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind
him.
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors
hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying

lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their

feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn

on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees
were swaying darkly in the distance.
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying
in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley

complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to

vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and
yellow eyes like a hawk.
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a
116broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck
out at odd angles.
"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the
front, "and say 'Up!"'
"UPF everyone shouted.

Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few
that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and

Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's
voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the

ground.
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding
off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it
wrong for years.
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said
Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come

straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three

-- two --"
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the
ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's

lips.
"Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a
cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his
scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,

slip sideways off the broom and --
WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass
in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and

started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.
"Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right,
117up you get.".
She turned to the rest of the class.

"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You
leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before
you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with
Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
"Did you see his face, the great lump?"
The other Slytherins joined in.

"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil.
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
Slytherin girl. "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,

Parvati."
"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the
grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
"Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking
to watch.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about --
up a tree?"
"Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick
and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level

with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it,
Potter!"
Harry grabbed his broom.
118"No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move --
you'll get us all into trouble."
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom
and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed

through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being
taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up

a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls

back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked
stunned.
"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!" "Oh,
yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom
tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy
only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and
held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
"Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball
high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and
then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down

-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball
-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people
watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he

caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled

gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
"HARRY POTTER!"
His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was
running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.
"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"
119Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses
flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"
"It wasn't his fault, Professor --"
"Be quiet, Miss Patil
"But Malfoy --"

"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now."

Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he
left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward
the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to

say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong

with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even

looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't

even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What
would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor
McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched

along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was

taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to

stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His
stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming
wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door
and poked her head inside.
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on
him?
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out
of Flitwicles class looking confused.
"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up
the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
120"In here."
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except
for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
"Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which
clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed
the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.
"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker."

Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
"Are you serious, Professor?"
"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural.
I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a

broomstick, Potter?"
Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he
didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming

back to his legs.
"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor
McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley

couldn't have done it."
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.

"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained.
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around
Harry and staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a

decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,

I'd say."
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the
first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape

in the face for weeks...."
121Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind
about punishing you."
Then she suddenly smiled.
"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent
Quidditch player himself."
"You're joking."

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened
when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of
steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about

it."Seeker?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest
house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his
mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the
afternoon. "Wood told me."
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.

"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood
wants to keep it a secret."
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and
hurried over.
"Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the
team too -- Beaters."
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"
said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is

going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping

when he told us."
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret
passageway out of the school."
"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found
in our first week. See you."
122Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome
turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the
Muggles?"
"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got
your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course

nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was

full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their

knuckles and scowl.
"I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want.
Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard

of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's
yours?"
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
"Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy
room; that's always unlocked."
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a
wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?"
"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually,
getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's

face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know,

with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send
sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real
damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway."
"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?"

"Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. "Excuse me."
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron.
123Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --"

"Bet you could," Ron muttered.
"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the
points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be.

It's really very selfish of you."
"And it's really none of your business," said Harry.

"Good-bye," said Ron.
All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,
Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus

falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had

spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you,

you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or
Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another

school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming

up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy

face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.
"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across
the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor

common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning

all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached

the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I
can't believe you're going to do this, Harry."
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe
and a frown.
"You!" said Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!"
"I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a
prefect, he'd put a stop to this."
Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
124"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady
and climbed through the hole.
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through
the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I
don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the

points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching

Spells."
"Go away." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said
when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --"
But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the
portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an

empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione

was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.
"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be
late."
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up
with them.
"I'm coming with you," she said.

"You are not."
"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying

to stop you, and you can back me up."
"You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly.

"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something."
It was a sort of snuffling.
"Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
125It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,
fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't
remember the new password to get in to bed."
"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't
help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere."
"How's your arm?" said Harry.

"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a
minute."
"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you
later --""Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to
stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and
Neville.
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that
Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the
Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned

them all forward.
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.
Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor

and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered
where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues

winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took
out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes

crept by.
126"He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered.
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised
his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly
at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried

silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had

barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy

room.
"They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding."
"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to
creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch

getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke

into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of
them toppled right into a suit of armor.
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

"RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not
looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the

doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,
without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled

along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was

miles from the trophy room.
"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall
and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and
spluttering.
I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,
"I -- told -- you."
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as
possible."
"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't
you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to
127be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off."
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her
that.
"Let's go."
It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen
paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a

classroom in front of them.
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
Peeves cackled.

"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,
naughty, you'll get caughty."
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
"Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his
eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know."
"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a
big mistake.
"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED
DOWN THE

CHARMS CORRIDOR"Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.
"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're
done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as

fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.
"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the
lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"
The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut
128it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me."

"Say 'please."'
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his
annoying singsong voice.
"All right -please."
"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing

away and Filch cursing in rage.
"He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay
-- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?"
Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he
was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of

everything that had happened so far.
They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that
filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.

Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching
and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging
in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry
knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their

sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting
over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take
Filch.
129They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they
almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look

for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they

hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible

between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their
bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the
portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and
collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked
as if he'd never speak again.
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up
in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one
does."
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You
don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see

what it was standing on.
"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too
busy with its heads."
"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously
guarding something."
She stood up, glaring at them.
I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --
or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
"No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along,
wouldn't you.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
130back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to

hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package
from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
CHAPTER TEN
HALLOWEEN

Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the

three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite

keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the

package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and

they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy
protection. "It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron.
"Or both," said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it
was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what

it was without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never

going near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a
bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really
wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great

delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention
was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech

owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in
this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped
it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had

hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top

of the parcel.
131Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody
knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood

will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your

first training session.
Professor McGonagall
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to
read."A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched
one."
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private
before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they

found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the

package from Harry and felt it.
"That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture
of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time,
Potter, first years aren't allowed them."
Ron couldn't resist it.

"It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron
grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same
league as the Nimbus."
"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the
handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to

save up twig by twig."
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.
"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.
132"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.
"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,

Potter. And what model is it?"
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the
look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here

that I've got it," he added.
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's
obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they

reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's
Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."
"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an
angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,

looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.
"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry.
"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good."

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It
kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying
under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be

learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without

noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap

the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it
looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long

tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold

near the top.
As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the
dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium

before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that

the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end
133of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They
reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle
children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick
and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out
of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two

Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
"Hey, Potter, come down!'

Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall
meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules

this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even
if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.

Three of them are called Chasers."
"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball
about the size of a soccer ball.
"This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the
Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to

score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the

hoops. Follow me?"
"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,"
Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with

six hoops, isn't it?"
"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind," said Harry
quickly.
"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm
Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other

team from scoring."
134"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember
it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are

they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.
"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this."
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are
the Bludgers."
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than
the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to
escape the straps holding them inside the box.
"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the
Bludgers.
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at
Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking

his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around

their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to

pin it to the ground.
"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate
and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to
knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each

team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their

side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So

-- think you've got all that?"
"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the
goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry

reeled off.
"Very good," said Wood.

"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he
sounded offhand.
"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse
than that. Now, the last member of the team is the
135Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the
Bludgers unless they crack my head open."
"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I
mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves."
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size

of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver

wings.
"This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important
ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and
difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave

in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it

before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the

Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they
nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages

-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on

substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any

questions?"
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was
doing it that was going to be the problem.
"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting
it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try

you out with a few of these."
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf

balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.
Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an
hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.
"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily
as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you

turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for

England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."
136Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice
three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly

believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two

months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His

lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
mastered the basics.
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin
wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced

in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,

something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make

Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the
class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which
was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,

however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell

whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to

either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.
"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as

usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic

words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,

who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a

buffalo on his chest."
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the
feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the

desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and

set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.
"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium
Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."
"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,
"Wingardium Leviosa!"
137Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their
heads.
"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here,
Miss Granger's done it!"
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder no
one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the

crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.
Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she
was in tears.
"I think she heard you."

"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed
she's got no friends."
Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all
afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,

Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that

Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.

Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had

entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out
of their minds.
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the

candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the

golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell
came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.

Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped

against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you

ought to know."
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from
the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.
138"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories
immediately!"
Percy was in his element.
"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if
you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years

coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!"
"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.

"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe
Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry

suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.
"I've just thought -- Hermione."
"What about her?"

"She doesn't know about the troll."

Ron bit his lip.
"Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped
down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'

bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick
footsteps behind them.
"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the
corridor and disappeared from view.
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons
with the rest of the teachers?"
"Search me."
139Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's
fading footsteps.
"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his
hand.
"Can you smell something?"
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old
socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of
gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,
something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and

watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite
gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head
perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks
with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was

holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its

arms were so long.
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its
long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in."
"Good idea," said Ron nervously.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't
about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the
key, slam the door, and lock it.
'Yes!"
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but
as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts
stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber
they'd just chained up.
"Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
140"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped.
"Hermione!" they said together.

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?
Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,
fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if
she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the

sinks off the walls as it went.
"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he
threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking
stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw

Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it
went.
"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he
threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe

hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning

its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward
the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,

her mouth open with terror.
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It
roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to
escape.
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He
took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the

troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there,

but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its

nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it
had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry
clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him
141off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand --
not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell

that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into
the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto

its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its

face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.
It was Hermione who spoke first.
"Is it -- dead?"

I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out."
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered
in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
"Urgh -- troll boogers."

He wiped it on the troll's trousers.
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.
They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,

someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A

moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,

closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell
took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly
down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and
Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.

Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's

mind.
"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with
cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with

his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in
142your dormitory?"
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He
wished Ron would put his wand down.
Then a small voice came out of the shadows.
"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."
"Miss Granger!"

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it
on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a
teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand

up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have
time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they
arrived."
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.

"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the
three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last
person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending

she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started

handing out sweets.
"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said
Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt

at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing

the feast in their houses."
Hermione left.
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have
143taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five
points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had
climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the

troll, quite apart from anything else.
"We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled.
"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."

"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind
you, we did save her."
"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with
her," Harry reminded him.
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
"Pig snout," they said and entered.
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that
had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting

for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking

at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are
some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and

knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
QUIDDITCHAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains
around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every

morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the

upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled
up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous
beaverskin boots.
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in
144his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If
Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house

championship.
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as
their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news
that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know
which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people

telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't
know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what

with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She
had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a
very interesting read.
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup

match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest
players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to
them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had

been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry
and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer

for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured
them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.

They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape

crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,

Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;

they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about
their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen
the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off

anyway.
"What's that you've got there, Potter?"

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape.
"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor."
145"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped
away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?"
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly.

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and
Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will

you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right

answers anyway.
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take
his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of
Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if
he could have it.
"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that
Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.
He knocked again. Nothing.
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed
the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above
his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing
Snape bandages.
"Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your
eyes on all three heads at once?"
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --
"POTTER!"

Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to
hide his leg. Harry gulped.
"I just wondered if I could have my book back."
"GET OUT! OUT!"
146Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He
sprinted back upstairs.
"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. "What's the matter?"

In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.
"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get
past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when

we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my

broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!"
Hermione's eyes were wide.
"No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he
wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"
snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But
what's he after? What's that dog guarding?"
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville
was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind

-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a

few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his

leg wasn't easy to forget.
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of
the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of

everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
"You've got to eat some breakfast."
"I don't want anything."
"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione.

"I'm not hungry."
Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are
always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."
147"Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his
sausages.
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around
the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be
raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going
on sometimes.
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in
the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on

one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and

Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion
underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that
the paint flashed different colors.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were
changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing

in green).
Wood cleared his throat for silence.
"Okay, men," he said.

"And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
"And women," Wood agreed. "This is it."
"The big one," said Fred Weasley.

"The one we've all been waiting for," said George.
"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the
team last year."
"Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had
in years. We're going to win. I know it."
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else."
"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you."
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his
148knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting
for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all
gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry

thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the

corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing

Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
"Mount your brooms, please."
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the
Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what
an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --"
"JORDAN!"

"Sorry, Professor."
The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the
match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet,
a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to

Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin
Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying
like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent

move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle --

that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint,

off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of

the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's

Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a
second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell
which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in

possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's

really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead
149-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses --
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the
Slytherins.
"Budge up there, move along."
"Hagrid!"

Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join
them.
"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of
binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the

crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?"
"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet."
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his
binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for
some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had
said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to
let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.

Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection

from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to
come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger
furiously toward Marcus Flint.
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks
two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --
wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too
150busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his
left ear.
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the
streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck

and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have
forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to
watch.
Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings
fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint
had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry
holding on for dear life.
"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors.

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the
goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the
Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red
card!"
"What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron.
"Red card!" said Dean furiously. "In soccer you get shown the red card
and you're out of the game!"
"But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him.
Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.
"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the
air."Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.
151"I mean, after that open and revolting foul
'Jordan, I'm warning you --"

"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which
could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by
Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor
still in possession."
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously
past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening

lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped

the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt
anything like that.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him
off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their

riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts

-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he
realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't
turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the

air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that

almost unseated him.
Lee was still commentating.
"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --
passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose

-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's
broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away
from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through
his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of

his broom... but he can't have...."
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His
broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to
hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild

jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on

with only one hand.
152"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered.
"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere
with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to

a Nimbus Two Thousand."
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of
looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced.

"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look."
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands
opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop

under his breath.
"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione.
"What should we do?"
"Leave it to me."

Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned
the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was
almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on
its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull

Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time

they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower

and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.

MarcusFlint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately.

Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and
was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say
sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a

few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the

hem of Snape's robes.
153It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him

into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --

Snape would never know what had happened.
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on
to his broom.
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into
Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his
hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field
on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the
game ended in complete confusion.
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling
twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken

any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --

Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry

heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back

in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was
cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next
to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell
him. Harry decided on the truth.
"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying

to steal whatever it's guarding."
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
"How do you know about Fluffy?" he said.
154"Fluffy?"
"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub
las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
"Yes?" said Harry eagerly.
"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret,
that is."
"But Snape's trying to steal it."

"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do
nothin' of the sort."
"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.

The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about
Snape.
I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!
You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw
him!"
"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why
Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!
Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don'

concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what

it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel

--""Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,
is there?"
Hagrid looked furious with himself.
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE MIRROR OF ERISEDChristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find
155itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that

they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The

few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to

deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could

fly off again.
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common
room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had

become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.

Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where

their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as

possible to their hot cauldrons.
"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all
those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're

not wanted at home."
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch

match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get

everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing

Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny,

because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay

on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back
to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of

students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up

at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be
the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying,
too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit

Charlie.
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large
fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at

the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the
branches.
156"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron."
"Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from
behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping

to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut

of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used
to."
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.

"WEASLEY!"

Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.
"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family."
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said
Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it
isn't more. Move along, all of you."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering
needles everywhere and smirking.
"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of
these days, I'll get him --"
"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape."
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what,
come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat."
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great
Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with

the Christmas decorations.
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all
around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood
around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with

hundreds of candles.
157"How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked.
"Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got
half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor
Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was
trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
"The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before
the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"
"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you
mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is."
"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop
it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione.
"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We
must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him

anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere."
"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.
"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left
Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid
had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape

was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to
begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a
book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable

Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern

Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And

then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of

thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to
search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them

off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted

Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in
158there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never

get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never

taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced

Defense Against the Dark Arts.
"What are you looking for, boy?"
"Nothing," said Harry.

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.

"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!"
Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left
the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not

ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be

able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were

up to.Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found
anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two

weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it

wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a

nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.
They went off to lunch.
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And
send me an owl if you find anything."
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron.
"It'd be safe to ask them."
"Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione.

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time
to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the
common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the
good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they

could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows

-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk
159about even if they wouldn't work.
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like
Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot

like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.

Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in
his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen
weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble

getting them to do what he wanted.
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't
trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept

shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't
send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose
him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next

day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.

When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a

small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and
pulled on his bathrobe.
"You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"

"What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which
was a lot bigger than Harry's.
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and
scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut

wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --

it sounded a bit like an owl.
A second, very small parcel contained a note.
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
"That's friendly," said Harry.
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
"Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?"
160"You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. "Hagrid
and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?"
"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and
pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect

any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley
sweater."Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in
emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
"Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and
mine's always maroon."
"That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was
very tasty.
His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs
from Hermione.
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very
light. He unwrapped it.
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it
lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of
Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it

is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."
"What is it?"
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to
the touch, like water woven into material.
"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm
sure it is -- try it on."
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
"It is! Look down!"
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the
161mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak

over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
"There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!"
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,
loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your

father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was

returned to you. Use it well.
A Very Merry Christmas to you.
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the
cloak."I'd give anything for one of these," he said. "Anything. What's the
matter?"
"Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had
it really once belonged to his father?
Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung
open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak

quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else
yet.
"Merry Christmas!"

"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!"
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on
it, the other a G.
"Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's
sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it
on, they're lovely and warm."
"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.
162"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she
thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're

called Gred and Forge."
"What's all th is noise.
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He
had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,

carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which
Fred seized.

"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even
Harry got one."
"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater
over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said
George. "Christmas is a time for family."
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by
his sweater.
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of
chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy

and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet

along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the

feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little

plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard
cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like
a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the

inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at

the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a

flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick

had just read him.
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his
teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid

getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,

finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's
163amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of
things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous

balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.

The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball
fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they

returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in

his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he

wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,
everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and

watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because

they'd stolen his prefect badge.
It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been
nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed

was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had

sent it.
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,
fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his
four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the
cloak out from under it.
His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow
over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note

had said.
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak
around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and

shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
Use it well.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him
in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the

dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch

would never know.
164Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back
-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he

wanted to use it alone.
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,
and climbed through the portrait hole.
"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked
quickly down the corridor.
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then
it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to
read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he

walked.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his
way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along
in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the
sight gave him the creeps.
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping
carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the

library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.
They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled
words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.

One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The

hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,

maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,

as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,
he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large

black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with

difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,

let it fall open.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was
screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one

high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over

his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming
165down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the
shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild

eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's

outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks

still ringing in his ears.
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been
so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where

he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he

was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he

must be five floors above there.
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was
wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted
Section."Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must
know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and

to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well,
they can't be far, we'll catch them."
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner
ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor

and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak

didn't stop him from being solid.
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It
was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying

not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room

without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry

leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps

dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before
he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs
were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper

basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that

didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone

had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved

around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic
166fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved
nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection

again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but
a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to
the mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,
reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his
shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,

too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's

trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt
the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their

reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the

others existed only in the mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her
eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the
glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that
she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,

black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore

glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as

Harry's did.
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching
that of his reflection.
"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the
faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green
eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as
though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,

for the first time in his life.
167The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at
them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping

to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache

inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade
and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He

tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back,"

and hurried from the room.
"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly.
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.
"I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly.

"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to
show me your other brothers and everyone."
"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house
this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not

finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you

eating anything?"
Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them
again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very
important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?

What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
"Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd."
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror
room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much

more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the

library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back."
"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere."
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,
but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead
168with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
"It's here -- just here -- yes!"

They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his
shoulders and ran to the mirror.
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
"See?" Harry whispered.

"I can't see anything."
"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...."
"I can only see you."

"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am."
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't
see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.

"Look at me!" he said.
"Can you see all your family standing around you?"
"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head
boy!"
"What?"
"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the
house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at
Harry.
"Do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --"
169"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I
want to see my parents."
"Don't push me --"
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
"Quick!"

Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris
came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the
same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she

turned and left.
"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.
Come on."
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.

"Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron.
"No."
"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"

"No... you go..."
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back
tonight."
"Why not?"

"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had
too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into
you? What if you knock something over?"
"You sound like Hermione."
170"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in
front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was
walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he

didn't meet anyone.
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of
his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in

front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
night with his family. Nothing at all.
Except --
"So -- back again, Harry?"
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind
him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus

Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to

get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.
" -- I didn't see you, sir."
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of

the Mirror of Erised."
"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."
"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"

"It -- well -- it shows me my family --"
"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy."
"How did you know --?"
171"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently.
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?"
Harry shook his head.

"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it
and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?"
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want...
whatever we want..."
"Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have
never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,

who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing

alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us

neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by

what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is
real or even possible.
"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will

now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,

remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and

get off to bed?"
Harry stood up.
"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?"

"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one
more thing, however."
"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"

"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."

Harry stared.
"One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on

giving me books."
172It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved

Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
NICOLAS FLAMEL
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the

invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry
wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he
couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed

about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high

voice cackled with laughter.
"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said
Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different
view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being

out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had

caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who

Nicolas Flamel was.
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary
book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.

Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten

minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other

two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that
had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys

complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's

side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would

overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven

years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer
nightmares when he was tired out after training.
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave
the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the
173Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off
their brooms.
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of
thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll

be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's
he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we

might overtake Slytherin."
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for
not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the
end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common

room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only

thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very

good for her.
"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry's face. "What's the

matter with you? You look terrible."
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other
two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
"Don't play," said Hermione at once.

"Say you're ill," said Ron.

"Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested.
"Really break your leg," said Ron.
"I can't," said Harry. "There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out,
174Gryffindor can't play at all."
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed
to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs

had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the

Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to
Gryffindor tower.
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed
the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,

trembling. "What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit

with Harry and Ron.
"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said
he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"

Neville shook his head.
"I don't want more trouble," he mumbled.
"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He's used to
walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of

him and make it easier."
"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,
Malfoy's already done that," Neville choked out.
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,
the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He

gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.
"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you
for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.

"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you
collect them, don't you?"
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.
175"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-"
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron
and Hermione.
"I've found him!" he whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read
the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen
to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark

wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of

dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas

Flamel'!"
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd
gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.
"Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'
dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks

before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this
out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,

muttering to herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
"I knew it! I knew it!"

"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
"Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker
of the Sorcerer's Stone!"
This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.

"The what?" said Harry and Ron.
"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there."
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient
study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a
176legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which

will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries,
but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel,
the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six
hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon

with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
"See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must be
guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it

safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it,
that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Harry. "No
wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it."
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent
Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly recent if he's
six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down
different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still

discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It

wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry
remembered about Snape and the coming match.
"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the
Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show

them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione.
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,
whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm,

either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was

wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed

to, with such a biased referee?
Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to
keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered

whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions
177lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so
horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the

Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had

the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the
next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever
see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry

hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch

robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to
Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or
why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker

Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were

ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron
slipped his wand up his sleeve.
"I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag."

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.

"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early
capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff too much."
"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the
door. "Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"
Harry's heart did a somersault.
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.
There was no mistaking that silver beard.
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was
simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was
watching.
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched
onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.
178"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look -they're
off Ouch!"
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.

"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone
want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because
George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her

fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was

circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said
Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another
penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See,

there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've

got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no

brains."
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not
daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and
that's saying something."
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety
about Harry.
"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word
"Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --"
"What? Where?"
179Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and
cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her

mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the
ground!" said Malfoy.
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of
him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over

the back of his seat to help.
"Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as
Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron
rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the

whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see
something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next
second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the
Snitch clasped in his hand.
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember
the Snitch being caught so quickly.
"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won!
Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on
her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe
it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five

minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his
shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.
"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.
"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping

busy... excellent..."
Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two
Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling
180happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could
say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never

smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour

in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him

onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and

down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked
up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.

Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....
And speaking of Snape...
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly
not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the

forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He

recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest

while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding
silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He

followed.
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in
circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he

heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering
beech tree.
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his
broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy

clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.

Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.
"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,
Severus..."
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy.
"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after
all."
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted
him.
181"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
"B-b-but Severus, I --"

"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step
toward him.
"I-I don't know what you

"You know perfectly well what I mean."

An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied
himself in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
I'm waiting."
"B-but I d-d-don't --"

"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when
you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties
lie."
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was
almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as

though he was petrified.
"Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked.
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. "And
I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle

single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all

right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the
common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and
stuff from the kitchens."
"Never mind that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty
room, you wait 'til you hear this...."
He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them,
then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to
force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past
182Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon
there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of

enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts

spell that Snape needs to break through --"
"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?" said Hermione in alarm.
"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the
weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it

didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was

still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,

which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed

Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron

had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She
had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.

Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the

same.
"Hermione, the exams are ages away."
"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That's not ages, that's like a second to
Nicolas Flamel."
"But we're not six hundred years old," Ron reminded her. "Anyway, what
are you studying for, you already know it A."
"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass
these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I

should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten

into me...."
183Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines
as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter

holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard

to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's

blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron
spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get
through all their extra work.
"I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down
his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the

first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear,

forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
Harry, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and
Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid! What are you

doing in the library?"
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked
very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
"Jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at
once. "An' what're you lot up ter?" He looked suddenly suspicious. "Yer

not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?" "Oh, we found out who he

is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's

guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --"
"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?"
"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said
Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --"
"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not
promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it

in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh

--""See you later, then," said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.
"What was he hiding behind his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully.
184"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?"
"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron, who'd had enough of
working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms

and slammed them down on the table.
"Dragons!" he whispered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!
Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to

Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide."
"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever
met him, " said Harry.
"But it's against our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by
the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop

Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden -

anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns

Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania."
"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry.
"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean
Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.

Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to

make them forget."
"So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione.
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later,
they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid

called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door
quickly behind them.
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there
was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them

stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?"
"Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were
wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone

apart from Fluffy."
185Hagrid frowned at him.
"0' course I cant, he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two,
yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That

Stone's here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I
s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou'
Fluffy."
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,
you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm,

flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was

smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione
went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,
apart from you."
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at
Hermione.
"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he
borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...

Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he

ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore

himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh

yeah, Professor Snape."
"Snape?"
"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped
protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it."
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape
had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out
how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything --

except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.
"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,
Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?

Not even one of the teachers?"
"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly.
"Well, that's something," Harry muttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we
186have a window open? I'm boiling."
"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the
fire. Harry looked at it, too.
"Hagrid -- what's that?"
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,
underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
"Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er..."

"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get
a closer look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune."
"Won it," said Hagrid. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a
few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was

quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione.
"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book
from under his pillow. "Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding

for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's

all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I

em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with
chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize
diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're

rare, them."
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.
"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said.
But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the
fire.So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to
Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening
after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were

getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and

Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.
187Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.
He had written only two words: It's hatching.
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione
wouldn't hear of it.
"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon
hatching?"
"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what
Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --"
"Shut up!" Harry whispered.
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How
much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,
Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during
morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their

lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried

through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,

looking flushed and excited.
"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside.
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something
was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated
breath.
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby
dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought

it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge

compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils,

the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
"Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke
the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.
188"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said Hagrid.
"Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,
exactly?"
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face
-- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
"What's the matter?"

"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid --
he's runnin' back up ter the school."
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no
mistaking him.
Malfoy had seen the dragon.
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week
made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their

free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.
"Just let him go," Harry urged. "Set him free."

"I can't," said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd die."
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a
week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing

his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There

were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
"I've decided to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon
with misty eyes. "He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!

Where's Mommy?"
"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered in Harry's ear.

"Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to
be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment."
Hagrid bit his lip.
189"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I
can't."
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.

"You're losing it, too," said Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?"
"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.
We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put

him back in the wild!"
"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, Hagrid?"
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to
ask him.
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry
sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to

bed. The clock on the wall had just
chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of
nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at

Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by

the crate."It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a
bloody handkerchief. "I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a
week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met,

but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little

bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when

I left, he was singing it a lullaby."
There was a tap on the dark window.
"It's Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. "She'll have
Charlie's answer!"
The three of them put their heads together to read the note.
Dear Ron,How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian
Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing
190will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to
visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal

dragon.
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on
Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still
dark.
Send me an answer as soon as possible.

Love,

Charlie
They looked at one another.
"We've got the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It shouldn't be too
difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and

Norbert."
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two
agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to
twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam

Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,
he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked
as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day
to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
"It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's
about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of

my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept

threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a

dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the

Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this
didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke
191into a sweat.
"Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. "Oh no oh no -- I've
just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's

going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came
over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven't
got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance

to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the

invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."
They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail
when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
"I won't let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin'
I can't handle."
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears,
although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the

leg."Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only
a baby, after all."
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry
and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come

quickly enough.
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say
good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had
to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late

arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get

out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis

against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey," said Hagrid in
a muffled voice. "An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets
lonely."
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as
192though the teddy was having his head torn off.
"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the
crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.

"Mommy will never forget you!"
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never
knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble

staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another

staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the

work much easier.
"Nearly there!" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the
tallest tower.
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.
Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the

shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each

other ten feet away. A lamp flared.
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by
the ear."Detention!" she shouted. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering
around in the middle of the night, how dare you --"
"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a
dragon!"
"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see
Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!"
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest
thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the

cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe

properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!"
"Don't," Harry advised her.
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his
crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out
193of the darkness.
Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the
harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.

They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and

Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as
their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in

detention -- what could spoil their happiness?
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they
stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the

darkness.
"Well, well, well," he whispered, "we are in trouble."
They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.
CHAPTER FIFTEENTHE FORIBIDDEN FORESTThings couldn't have been worse.
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor,
where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione

was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each

other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't
see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?

There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for

their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of

night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was

out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility

cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.
When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.
194"Harry!" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. "I was
trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to

catch you, he said you had a drag --"
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor
McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert
as she towered over the three of them.
"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were
up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain

yourselves."
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's
question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor
McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco

Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of

bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's
funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?"
Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this
wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,

blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and

find them in the dark, to warn them.
"I'm disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. "Four students out of bed in
one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I

thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor

meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions --

yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around

school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty
points will be taken from Gryffindor."
"Fifty?" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in
the last Quidditch match.
"Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily
through her long, pointed nose.
"Professor -- please
"You can't --"
195"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all
of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students."
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In
one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house
cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How
could they ever make up for this?
Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his
pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to

say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the

dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what
they'd done?
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the
house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they

suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then

the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,
their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points,
him and a couple of other stupid first years.
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,
Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs

turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose

the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble
to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other
hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "Thanks

Potter, we owe you one!"
Only Ron stood by him.
"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads
of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like

them."
"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have
they?" said Harry miserably.
"Well -- no," Ron admitted.
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not
to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it
196with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he
went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What good'll that do? How are we going to get
any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?"
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak
to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they

called him "the Seeker."
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time
as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to

them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying
he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to

themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the

ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,
memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new
resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put

to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one

afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he

drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.
"No -- no -- not again, please --"
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.

"All right -- all right --" he heard Quirrell sob.
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening
his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He

strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.

He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into

the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.

Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised
himself about not meddling.
All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had
just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be
197walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given
in at last.
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on
Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.
"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break
his Anti-Dark Force spell --"
"There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione.

"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"
said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet
there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant
three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione
answered before Harry could.
"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try
anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
"But we've got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell's too scared to back us
up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at

Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you

think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him,
Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help
us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the

more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget,

we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot

of explaining."
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
"If we just do a bit of poking around --"

"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough poking around."

He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of
its moons.
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and
Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
198Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch
in the entrance hall.
Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do
in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to
complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't
say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.
At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common
room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already

there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had

gotten a detention, too.
"Follow me," said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you,
eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes... hard work and pain are the

best teachers if you ask me.... It's just a pity they let the old
punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a
few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in

case they're ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don't think of

running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do."
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry
wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something
really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them
into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's

hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started."
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it
wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because

Filch said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that

oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm

much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his
tracks.
199"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual.
"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there

-- werewolves, I heard."
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.
"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with
glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble,

shouldn't you?"
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He
was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his

shoulder.
"Abou' time," he said. "I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All
right, Harry, Hermione?"
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly,
they're here to be punished, after all."
"That's why yer late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. "Bin
lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit,

I'll take over from here."
"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added
nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp
bobbing away in the darkness.
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.

"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear
the note of panic in his voice.
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely.
"Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it."
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd
be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd
tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines!
What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get out.

If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off

ter the castle an' pack. Go on"'
200Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his
gaze."Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous
what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow
me over here a moment."
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he
pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the

thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into

the forest.
"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt

badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead

last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have

ter put it out of its misery."
"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?" said Malfoy,
unable to keep the fear out of his voice.
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with
me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're

gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent

directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin'
around since last night at least."
"I want Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.

"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. " So me, Harry,
an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.
Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?
Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in

trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be

careful -- let's go."
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a
fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left
path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a
ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue
201blood on the fallen leaves.
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.

"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Harry asked.
"Not fast enough," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unicorn,
they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before."
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;
there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of

unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
"You all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispered. "Don' worry, it can't've
gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET

BEHIND THAT TREE!"
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a
towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow,
raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing

along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few

seconds, the sound faded away.
"I knew it, " he murmured. "There's summat in here that shouldn' be."
"A werewolf?" Harry suggested.
"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said Hagrid
grimly. "Right, follow me, but careful, now."
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
"Who's there?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm armed!"

And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a
man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming

chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws
dropped.
"Oh, it's you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. "How are yeh?"
202He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.
"Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful
voice. "Were you going to shoot me?"
"Can't be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an'
Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is

Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.))
"We'd noticed," said Hermione faintly.

"Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much,
up at the school?"
"Erm --"

"A bit," said Hermione timidly.
"A bit. Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. He flung back his head
and stared at the sky. "Mars is bright tonight."
"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "Listen, I'm glad we've run inter
yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then
sighed again.
"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been
for ages past, so it is now."
"Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin'
unusual?"
"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him
impatiently. "Unusually bright."
"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said
Hagrid. "So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?"
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest
hides many secrets."
203A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,
but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and

wilder-looking than Ronan.
"Hullo, Bane," said Hagrid. "All right?"
"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?"
"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in
here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin'

about it?"
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. "Mars is
bright tonight," he said simply.
"We've heard," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either of you do see
anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then."
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their
shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
"Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a
centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the

moon."
"Are there many of them in here?" asked Hermione.
"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're
good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind,

centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much."
"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?" said Harry.
"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's
bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before."
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking
nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being

watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's
arm.
"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!"
204"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay on the path, I'll come back
for yeh!"
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking
at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the
rustling of leaves around them.
"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?" whispered Hermione.

"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our
fault he's here in the first place."
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's
seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.

What was going on? Where were the others?
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,
Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,
had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had
panicked and sent up the sparks.
"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were
makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'

Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry," Hagrid

added in a whisper to Harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin'
you, an' we've gotta get this done."
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They
walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until

the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so

thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were
splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been
thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,

through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
"Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.

Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen
anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at

odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on
205the dark leaves.
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him
freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....

Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the

ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood
transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head
over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
"AAAAAAAAAARGH!"

Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded
figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was
dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward
Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as
though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He

heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over
Harry, charging at the figure.
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a
minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur

was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he

had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
"Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?"

The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar
that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.
"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid.
The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride?

It will be quicker this way.
"My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front
legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the
clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks
206heaving and sweaty.
"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your
back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Potter boy. The
quicker he leaves this forest, the better."
"What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze, we
are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read

what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was
acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.
Bane kicked his back legs in anger.

"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with
what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like
donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had
to grab his shoulders to stay on.
"Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not
understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that
secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes,
with humans alongside me if I must."
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,
they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.
"Why's Bane so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me from,
anyway?"
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of
low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made
their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought
Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a

particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly

stopped.
207"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?"
"No," said Harry, startled by the odd question. "We've only used the
horn and tail hair in Potions."
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said
Firenze. "Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain,

would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive,

even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have

slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have

but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your

lips."
Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in
the moonlight.
"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. "If you're going to be
cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"
"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long
enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to

full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.

Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very

moment?"
"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't
understand who --"
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,
who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's
heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what

Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died.

Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to

die."
"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-"
"Harry! Harry, are you all right?"
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along
208behind her.
"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. "The
unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to
examine the unicorn. "You are safe now."
Harry slid off his back.

"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. "The planets have been read
wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those

times."
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry
shivering behind him.
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to
return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly
shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as
Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He
was still shaking.
"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the
forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get
rich...."
"Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he
thought Voldemort could hear them.
Harry wasn't listening.
"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious...
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to

happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks

Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written

in the stars as well."
"Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed.
"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone," Harry
209went on feverishly, "then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me
off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy."
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.

"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever
afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway,
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,

and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed
exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak
folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:
Just in case.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR

In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to
get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting

through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could
be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did
their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the

exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by
one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across

a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox

-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if

it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks

while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his
forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the

forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because

Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by
210his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there
was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,
or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron

and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea
of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in
dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much

time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering
questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons

and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam
results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put
down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help

cheering with the rest.
"That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they
joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have
learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of
Elfric the Eager."
Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron
said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and

flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the

tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No
more studying," Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You
could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how

badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet."
Harry was rubbing his forehead.
"I wish I knew what this means!" he burst out angrily. "My scar keeps
hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."
"Go to Madam Pomfrey," Hermione suggested.

"I'm not ill," said Harry. "I think it's a warning... it means danger's
coming...."
Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as
211Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out
how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not

going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for

England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."
Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was
something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to
explain this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last

night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I

remembered we'd done that one."
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do
with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across
the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only
one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.

Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
"Where're you going?" said Ron sleepily.
"I've just thought of something," said Harry. He had turned white.
"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now."
"Why?" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
"Don't you think it's a bit odd," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy
slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and

a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How

many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?

Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?"
"What are you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the
grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and
sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.
"Hullo," he said, smiling. "Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?"
"Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off.
"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know
212that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards
with look like?"
"Dunno," said Hagrid casually, "he wouldn' take his cloak off."

He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head --
that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn'

he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up."
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. "What did you talk to him
about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?"
"Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....

He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told

him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an'

then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks....
Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play
cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he

didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a

dragon would be easy..."
"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?" Harry asked, try ing
to keep his voice calm.
"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around
Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to

calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off

ter sleep --"
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out. "Forget I said it! Hey --
where're yeh goin'?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they
came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy
after the grounds.
"We've got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry. "Hagrid told that stranger
how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that
213cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope
Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop

him. Where's Dumbledore's office?"
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the
right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor
did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
"We'll just have to --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across
the hall.
"What are you three doing inside?"
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
"We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely,
Harry and Ron thought.
"See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though
this was a very fishy thing to want to do. "Why?"
Harry swallowed -- now what?

"It's sort of secret," he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because
Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.
"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly. "He
received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for

London at once."
"He's gone?" said Harry frantically. "Now?"
"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many
demands on his time --
"But this is important."

"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic,
Potter."Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's
about the Sorcerer's tone --"
214Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books
she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.

"How do you know --?" she spluttered.
"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try
and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don't
know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can

possibly steal it, it's too well protected."
"But Professor --"
"Potter, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent down
and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and

enjoy the sunshine."
But they didn't.
"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was
out of earshot. "Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found

out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He

sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when

Dumbledore turns up."
"But what can we --"
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.

Snape was standing there.
"Good afternoon," he said smoothly.
They stared at him.

"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd,
twisted smile.
"We were --" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.
"You want to be more careful," said Snape. "Hanging around
215like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor
really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?"
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.
"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will
personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you."
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.

Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.
"Right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered urgently. "One of us
has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and

follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that."
"Why me?"
"It's obvious," said Ron. "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor
Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick,

I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'"
"Oh, shut up," said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for
Snape.
"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," Harry told Ron.
"Come on."
But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the
door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor

McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of
enchantments!" she stormed. "Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've

come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from

Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!" Harry and Ron went back to

the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's

tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came
in."I'm sorry, Harry!" she wailed. "Snape came out and asked me what I was
doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,
216and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went."
"Well, that's it then, isn't it?" Harry said.

The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.
"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone
first.""You're mad!" said Ron.

"You can't!" said Hermione. "After what McGonagall and Snape have said?
You'll be expelled!"
"SO WHAP" Harry shouted. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of
the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like

when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get

expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark

Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think
he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house
cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to

go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's

only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over

to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing

you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?"
He glared at them.
"You're right Harry," said Hermione in a small voice.

"I'll use the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It's just lucky I got it
back."
"But will it cover all three of us?" said Ron.
"All -- all three of us?"

"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?"
"Of course not," said Hermione briskly. "How do you think you'd get to
the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there

might be something useful..."
217"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too."
"Not if I can help it," said Hermione grimly. "Flitwick told me in
secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not

throwing me out after that."
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.
Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to

Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset

by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come

across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry

and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they

were about to do.
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.
"Better get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,
stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He

putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had
given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't
feel much like singing.
He ran back down to the common room.

"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of
us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --"
"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville
appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked

as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.
"Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak
behind his back.
Neville stared at their guilty faces.

"You're going out again," he said.

"No, no, no," said Hermione. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,
Neville?"
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford
to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.
218"You can't go out," said Neville, "you'll be caught again. Gryffindor
will be in even more trouble."
"You don't understand," said Harry, "this is important."
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.
I won't let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand in front of the
portrait hole. "I'll -- I'll fight you!"
"Neville, "Ron exploded, "get away from that hole and don't be an idiot
--""Don't you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don't think you should be
breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to

people!"
"Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. "Neville, you don't know
what you're doing."
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt
out of sight.
"Go on then, try and hit me!" said Neville, raising his fists. "I'm
ready!"
Harry turned to Hermione.
"Do something," he said desperately.

Hermione stepped forward.
"Neville," she said, "I'm really, really sorry about this."
She raised her wand.

"Petrificus Totalus!" she cried, pointing it at Neville.
Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole
body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,

stiff as a board.
219Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he
couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.
"What've you done to him?" Harry whispered.

"It's the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably. "Oh, Neville, I'm so
sorry."
"We had to, Neville, no time to explain," said Harry.

"You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him
and pulled on the invisibility cloak.
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a
very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked

like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping

down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.

Norris skulking near the top.
"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but
Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris

turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the
third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that

people would trip.
"Who's there?" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed
his wicked black eyes. "Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are

you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
Harry had a sudden idea.

"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the Bloody Baron has his own
reasons for being invisible."
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time
and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
220"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. "My
mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're

invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir."
"I have business here, Peeves," croaked Harry. "Stay away from this
place tonight."
"I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air
again. "Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you."
And he scooted off

"Brilliant, Harry!" whispered Ron.
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor
-- and the door was already ajar.
"Well, there you are," Harry said quietly, "Snape's already got past
Fluffy."
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them
what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other

two.
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you," he said. "You can take the
cloak, I won't need it now."
"Don't be stupid," said Ron.
"We're coming," said Hermione.

Harry pushed the door open.
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of
the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it

couldn't see them.
"What's that at its feet?" Hermione whispered.
"Looks like a harp," said Ron. "Snape must have left it there."
"It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Harry. "Well, here
goes..."
221He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but
from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew

breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and

fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
"Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath

as they approached the giant heads. "I think we'll be able to pull the

door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back. "Want to go first,

Hermione?"
"No, I don't!"
"All right." Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's
legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and

open.
"What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously.
"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just
have to drop."
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his
attention and pointed at himself.
"You want to go first? Are you sure?" said Ron. "I don't know how deep
this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep."
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog
growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell

back into its deep sleep.
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no
sign of the bottom.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, "If anything happens to

me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore, right?"
"Right," said Ron.
222"See you in a minute, I hope...
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,
down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on

something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the

gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,
which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.

"What's this stuff?" were his first words.
"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.
Come on, Hermione!"
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.
"We must be miles under the school , she said.
"Lucky this plant thing's here, really," said Ron.

"Lucky!" shrieked Hermione. "Look at you both!"
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist

snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs

had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant
off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster

the plant wound around them.
"Stop moving!" Hermione ordered them. "I know what this is -- it's
Devil's Snare!"
"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his

neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Hermione.
223"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.
"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it
likes the dark and the damp
"So light a fire!" Harry choked.
"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. "ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?"
"Oh, right!" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had

used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it

loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.

Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they

were able to pull free.
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he
joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
"Yeah," said Ron, "and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis --
'there's no wood,' honestly."
"This way," said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the
only way forward.
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of
water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and

Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,
he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'
bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad

enough...
"Can you hear something?" Ron whispered.

Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up
ahead.
"Do you think it's a ghost?"
224"I don't know... sounds like wings to me."
"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving."

They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly
lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,
jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the
opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron.

"Probably," said Harry. "They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if
they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll
run."
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted
across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at

him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He

pulled the handle, but it was locked.
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it
wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.
"Now what?" said Ron.

"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione.
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?
"They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly. "They're keys! Winged keys --
look carefully. So that must mean..." he looked around the chamber while

the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes -- look!
Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!"
"But there are hundreds of them!"

Ron examined the lock on the door.

"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the
handle."
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into
the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the
225bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to
catch one.
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He
had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's

weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large
silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and
stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one -- there -- no, there
-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into
the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
"We've got to close in on it!" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the
key with the damaged wing. "Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione,

stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right,

NOW!"
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry
streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and

with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one

hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in
his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment
the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very

battered now that it had been caught twice.
"Ready?" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They
nodded. He pulled the door open.
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as
they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an

astonishing sight.
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black
chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what
looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the
white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering

white chessmen had no faces.
226"Now what do we do?" Harry whispered.
"It's obvious, isn't it?" said Ron. "We've got to play our way across
the room."
Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
"How?" said Hermione nervously.
"I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen."

He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the
knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the
ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?" The black knight
nodded. Ron turned to the other two.
"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we've got to take the
place of three of the black pieces...."
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,
"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at

chess --"
"We're not offended," said Harry quickly. "Just tell us what to do."
"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90
next to him instead of that castle."
"What about you?"
"I'm going to be a knight," said Ron.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a
knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces

and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,

and Hermione took.
"White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across the board.
"Yes... look..."
A white pawn had moved forward two squares.
227Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he
sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?
"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right."
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white
queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he

lay quite still, facedown.
"Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to
take that bishop, Hermione, go on."
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.

Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in

danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white

pieces as they had lost black ones.
"We're nearly there," he muttered suddenly. "Let me think let me
think..."
The white queen turned her blank face toward him.

"Yes..." said Ron softly, "It's the only way... I've got to be taken."
"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.
"That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take
one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate

the king, Harry!"
"But --""Do you want to stop Snape or not?"

"Ron --"
"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!"
There was no alternative.
"Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. "Here I go - now,
228don't hang around once you've won."
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard
across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -

Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron

to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had
won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With

one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through

the door and up the next passageway.
"What if he's --?"
"He'll be all right," said Harry, trying to convince himself. "What do
you reckon's next?"
"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put
charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them

alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's."
They had reached another door.

"All right?" Harry whispered.
"Go on."
Harry pushed it open.

A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their
robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in
front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out

cold with a bloody lump on its head.
"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," Harry whispered as they
stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. "Come on, I can't

breathe."
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what
came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table

with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
229"Snape's," said Harry. "What do we have to do?"
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind
them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At

the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.
They were trapped.
"Look!" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry
looked over her shoulder to read it:
Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
One among us seven will let you move ahead,

Another will transport the drinker back instead,
Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.

Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,

To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;

Second, different are those who stand at either end,
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,

Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
230Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was
smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
"Brilliant," said Hermione. "This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be

stuck in here forever."
"But so will we, won't we?" "Of course not," said Hermione. "Everything
we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are

wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us

back through the purple."
"But how do we know which to drink?"
"Give me a minute."
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the
line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she

clapped her hands.
"Got it," she said. "The smallest bottle will get us through the black
fire -- toward the Stone."
Harry looked at the tiny bottle.

"There's only enough there for one of us," he said. "That's hardly one
swallow."
They looked at each other.

"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?"
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
"You drink that," said Harry. "No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab
brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor

and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to

Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while,

but I'm no match for him, really."
"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"
"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?" said Harry, pointing at his scar.
231"I might get lucky again."
Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her
arms around him.
"Hermione!"
"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know."
"I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of
him.
"Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important
things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"
"You drink first," said Harry. "You are sure which is which, aren't
you?"
"Positive," said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle
at the end, and shuddered.
"It's not poison?" said Harry anxiously.

"No -- but it's like ice."

"Quick, go, before it wears off."
"Good luck -- take care."
"GO!"

Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to
face the black flames.
"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.

It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle
down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking
his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing

but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
232There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even
Voldemort.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES
It was Quirrell.

"You!" gasped Harry.

Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.
"Me," he said calmly. "I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here,
Potter."
"But I thought -- Snape --"
"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,
either, but cold and sharp. "Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't

he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to

him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"
Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.
"But Snape tried to kill me!"
"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally
knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch

match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd

have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape
hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
"Snape was trying to save me?"

"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "\Why do you think he wanted to
referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it

again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything
with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was
trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...

and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you

tonight."
233Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped
themselves tightly around Harry.
"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on
Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what
was guarding the Stone."
"You let the troll in?"

"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what
I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while

everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not
only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog

didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.
"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
It was the Mirror of Erised.
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured,
tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with

something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the

time he gets back...."
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
"I saw you and Snape in the forest --" he blurted out.
"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the
back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.

He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could,

when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...."
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into
it."I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?"
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He
234had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.
"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much."

"Oh, he does," said Quirrell casually, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts
with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never
wanted you dead."
"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was
threatening you...."
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.
"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions
-- he is a great wizard and I am weak --"
"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Harry gasped.

"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I
traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of
ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong

I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too

weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I

have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me."

Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I

failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He
punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...."
Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon
Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that

very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.
Quirrell cursed under his breath.
"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break
it?"
Harry's mind was racing.
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he
thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the

mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where

it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up
235to?
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without
Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he

tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to

himself. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"
And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself
"Use the boy... Use the boy..."

Quirrell rounded on Harry.
"Yes -- Potter -- come here."
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry
got slowly to his feet.
"Come here," Quirrell repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see."Harry walked toward him.

I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I
see, that's all.
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that
seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in

front of the mirror, and opened them again.
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment
later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and
pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its

pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his

real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.
"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?"
Harry screwed up his courage.
"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I've
won the house cup for Gryffindor."
236Quirrell cursed again.
"Get out of the way," he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the
Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?
But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though
Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.
"He lies... He lies..."

"Potter, come back here!" Quirrell shouted. "Tell me the truth! What did
you just see?"
The high voice spoke again.
"Let me speak to him... face-to-face..."

"Master, you are not strong enough!"
"I have strength enough... for this...."
Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't
move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to

unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's

head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the
spot.
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there
should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most

terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red

eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
"Harry Potter..." it whispered.
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.

"See what I have become?" the face said. "Mere shadow and vapor ... I
have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always
been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn
blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell

drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,

I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give
237me that Stone in your pocket?"
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He
stumbled backward.
"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join
me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging
me for mercy..."
"LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly.

Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see
him. The evil face was now smiling.
"How touching..." it hissed. "I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your
parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a

courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying

to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have

died in vain."
"NEVER!"
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed "SEIZE HIM!"
and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At

once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as

though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his
might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head
lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and

saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering

before his eyes.
"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,
knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands
around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,

yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!"

And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go
of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see
they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
"Then kill him, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort.
238Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by
instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --
"AAAARGH!"
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:
Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible

pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough

pain to stop him from doing a curse.
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as
tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the
pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only
hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL HIM!

KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, "Harry!

Harry!"
He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and
fell into blackness, down ... down... down...
Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to
catch it, but his arms were too heavy.
He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How
strange.
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view
above him.
"Good afternoon, Harry," said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he
remembered: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir,
quick --"
"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said
Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."
"Then who does? Sir, I --"
"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the
hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next
239to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
"Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming. "What
happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a

complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your

friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to
send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam
Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated

it."
"How long have I been in here?"

"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved
you have come round, they have been extremely worried."
"But sit, the Stone

I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor
Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to
prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.
"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?"

"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it
became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just

left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you."
"It was you."
"I feared I might be too late."

"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --"
"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For
one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has

been destroyed."
"Destroyed?" said Harry blankly. "But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --"
"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.
"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had

a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
240"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?"
"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,
yes, they will die."
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.
"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas
and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long

day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great

adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As

much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings

would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of
choosing precisely those things that are worst for them." Harry lay
there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the

ceiling."Sir?" said Harry. "I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's
gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --"
"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear
of a name increases fear of the thing itself."
"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back,
isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"
"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking
for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.

He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers

as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his

return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to

fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed
again, and again, why, he may never return to power."
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then
he said, "Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can

tell me... things I want to know the truth about...."
"The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing,
and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall
answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which

case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie."
241"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried
to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the

first place?"
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not
now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.

When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are

ready, you will know."
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?"
"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot
understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your

mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to

have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,
will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,
full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,

could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person

marked by something so good."
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,
which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found
his voice again, Harry said, "And the invisibility cloak - do you know
who sent it to me?"
"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought
you might like it." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Useful things... your

father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food
when he was here."
"And there's something else..."

"Fire away."

"Quirrell said Snape --"
"Professor Snape, Harry." "Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because
he hated my father. Is that true?"
242"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.
Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive."
"What?"

"He saved his life."
"What?"
"Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people's minds work,
isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt....

I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt

that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to
hating your father's memory in peace...."
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he
stopped.
"And sir, there's one more thing..."
"Just the one?"
"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?"

"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant
ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only
one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be
able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or

drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,

enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie

Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come

across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost
my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't
you?"
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he
choked and said, "Alas! Ear wax!"
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
"Just five minutes," Harry pleaded.
"Absolutely not."
243"You let Professor Dumbledore in..."
"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need
rest.""I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam
Pomfrey..."
"Oh, very well," she said. "But five minutes only."

And she let Ron and Hermione in.
"Harry!"
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was
glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried
--""The whole school's talking about it," said Ron. "What really happened?"

It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more
strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:

Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a
very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry
told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
"So the Stone's gone?" said Ron finally. "Flamel's just going to die?"

"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to
the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
"I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite impressed
at how crazy his hero was.
"So what happened to you two?" said Harry.
"Well, I got back all right," said Hermione. "I brought Ron round --
that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact

Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he

just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the
244third floor."
"D'you think he meant you to do it?" said Ron. "Sending you your
father's cloak and everything?"
"Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible
-- you could have been killed."
"No, it isn't," said Harry thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumbledore.
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or

less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty

good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just

taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me
find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the
right to face Voldemort if I could...."
"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly.
"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The

points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but
the food'll be good."
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.

"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly.
After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.
I want to go to the feast," he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened
his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?"
"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said
stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize
how risky feasts could be. "And you have another visitor."
"Oh, good," said Harry. "Who is it?"

Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was
indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,
took one look at him, and burst into tears.
"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands.
I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only
245thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a
dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter

live as a Muggle!"
"Hagrid!" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and
remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. "Hagrid, he'd have
found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have
found out even if you hadn't told him."
"Yeh could've died!" sobbed Hagrid. "An' don' say the name!"

"VOLDEMORT!" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped
crying. "I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up,
Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate
Frog, I've got loads...."
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, "That reminds
me. I've got yeh a present."
"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?" said Harry anxiously, and at last
Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. "Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off

yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway,

got yeh this..."
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it
curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him
from every page were his mother and father.
"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer
photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?"
Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He
had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving

him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked

out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's

winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner

showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started
talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione

at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were
246standing up to look at him.
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.

"Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble you
with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our
delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a
little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get

them nice and empty before next year starts....
"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the
points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and

twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred
and seventy- two."
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a

sickening sight.
"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent
events must be taken into account."
The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.

"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out.
Let me see. Yes...
"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..."

Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor house fifty points."
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars
overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other

prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past

McGonagall's giant chess set!"
At last there was silence again.
"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the
247face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had
burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside

themselves -- they were a hundred points up. "Third -- to Mr. Harry

Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve
and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points

-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if

only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a
great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to

stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville

Longbottom."
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some
sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted

from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and

cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people

hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.

Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who
couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the
Body-Bind Curse put on him.
"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even
Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we

need a little change of decoration."
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet
and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a

towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor

McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye

and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed

one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back
to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at
Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would
248never, ever forget tonight.
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but
come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good

marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even

Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his
abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid
as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a

shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,
Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were

handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the
holidays ("I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said Fred
Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats

that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;

talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier;

eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;

pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling
into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened
old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate

in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out

of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.
"You must come and stay this summer," said Ron, "both of you -- I'll
send you an owl."
"Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to." People
jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle

world. Some of them called:
"Bye, Harry!"
"See you, Potter!"

"Still famous," said Ron, grinning at him.
"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry.
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. "There he is,
Mom, there he is, look!"
249It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at
Ron."Harry Potter!" she squealed. "Look, Mom! I can see
"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point."
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.

"Busy year?" she said.

"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.
Weasley."
"Oh, it was nothing, dear."

"Ready, are you?"
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking
furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station

full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,

looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
"You must be Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasley.
"In a manner of speaking," said Uncle Vernon. "Hurry up, boy, we haven't
got all day." He walked away.
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.

"See you over the summer, then."
"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said Hermione, looking
uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so

unpleasant.
"Oh, I will," said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was
spreading over his face. "They don't know we're not allowed to use magic
at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...."

Not for the Þ rst time, an argument had broken out over 
breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Durs-
ley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, 
hooting noise from his nephew HarryÕs room.
Ò

control that owl, itÕll have to go!Ó
Harry tried, yet again, to explain.
ÒSheÕs 
bored,
Ó he said. ÒSheÕs used to ß ying around outside. If I 
could just let her out at nightÑÓ
ÒDo I look stupid?Ó snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg 
dangling from his bushy mustache. ÒI know whatÕll happen if that 
owlÕs let out.Ó
He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, 
loud belch from the DursleysÕ son, Dudley.

3ÒAll right,Ó said Harry, Ò
all right ... 
ÓUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded  rhinoceros 
and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp 
eyes.
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Un-
cle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go o
!
  at 
any moment, because Harry Potter 
wasnÕt
 a normal boy. As a mat-
ter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.
Harry Potter was a wizard Ña wizard fresh from his Þ rst year at 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys 
were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to 
how Harry felt.
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant 
stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and 
ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions  master), 
the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleep-
ing in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the game-
keeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the 
grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the 
Wizarding world (six tall goalposts, four ß ying balls, and fourteen 
players on broomsticks).
All HarryÕs spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-
the-line Nimbus Two 
"
 ousand broomstick had been locked in a 
cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had 
come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on 
the House Quidditch team because he hadnÕt practiced all sum-
mer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school 
without any of his homework done?

4and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family 
was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked 
HarryÕs owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying 
messages to anyone in the Wizarding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon 
was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt 
Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and 
porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with bril-
liant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore 
round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped 
scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even 
for a wizard. 
!
 is scar was the only hint of HarryÕs very mysteri-
ous past, of the reason he had been left on the DursleysÕ doorstep 
eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse 
from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Vol de mort, whose 
name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. HarryÕs par-
ents had died in Vol de mortÕs attack, but Harry had escaped with 
his lightning scar, and somehow Ñnobody understood why Ñ
Vol de mortÕs powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to 
kill Harry.
So Harry had been brought up by his dead motherÕs sister and 
her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never 
understanding why he kept making odd things happen without 
meaning to, believing the DursleysÕ story that he had got his scar 
in the car crash that had killed his parents.
And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,

5and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place 
at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now 
the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the 
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in some-
thing smelly.
! e Dursleys hadnÕt even remembered that today happened to 
be HarryÕs twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadnÕt been high; 
theyÕd never given him a real present, let alone a cake Ñbut to ig-
nore it completely ... 
At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly 
and said, ÒNow, as we all know, today is a very important day.Ó
Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.
Ò
!
 is could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my ca-
reer,Ó said Uncle Vernon.
Harry went back to his toast. 
Of course,
 he thought bitterly, 
Un-
cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party.
 HeÕd been talk-
ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife 
were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge 
order from him (Uncle VernonÕs company made drills).
ÒI think we should run through the schedule one more time,Ó 
said Uncle Vernon. ÒWe should all be in position at eight oÕclock. 
Petunia, you will be Ñ?Ó
ÒIn the lounge,Ó said Aunt Petunia promptly, Òwaiting to wel-
come them graciously to our home.Ó
ÒGood, good. And Dudley?Ó
ÒIÕll be waiting to open the door.Ó Dudley put on a foul, sim-
pering smile. ÒMay I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?Ó
Ò!
 eyÕll 
love
 him!Ó cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.

Harry. ÒAnd

?ÓÒIÕll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending IÕm not

ÒIÕll announce dinner,Ó said Aunt Petunia.

Dudley, o

ÒAnd

ÒIÕll be in my room, making no noise and pretending IÕm not

ÒPrecisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compli-
ments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?Ó
ÒVernon tells me youÕre a 
wonderful
 golfer, Mr. Mason. ... 
Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason....Ó
ÒPerfect ... Dudley?Ó
ÒHow about ÑÔWe had to write an essay about our hero at 
school, Mr. Mason, and 
I wrote about 
you.
ÕÓ!
 is was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petu-
nia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under 
the table so they wouldnÕt see him laughing.
ÒAnd you, boy?Ó
Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.
ÒIÕll be in my room, making no noise and pretending IÕm not 
there,Ó he said.

any luck, IÕll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at

Harry couldnÕt feel too excited about this. He didnÕt think the 
Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on 
Privet Drive.

  into town to pick up the dinner jackets for 
Dudley and me. And

,Ó he snarled at Harry. ÒYou stay out of 
your auntÕs way while sheÕs cleaning.Ó
Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. 
He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang 
under his breath:
ÒHappy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me...Ó
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening 
pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had 
never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more 
even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron 
Weasley and Her mi one Granger. 
!
 ey, however, didnÕt seem to be 
missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all  summer, 
even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and 
stay.
Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking 
HedwigÕs cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Her mi one 
with a letter, but it wasnÕt worth the risk. Underage wizards werenÕt 
allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadnÕt told the

8 Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn 
them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking 
him
 in 
the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For 
the Þ rst couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering non-
sense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of 
the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long  silence 
from Ron and Her mi one had made Harry feel so cut o
!
  from the 
magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal Ñand 
now Ron and Her mi one had forgotten his birthday.
What wouldnÕt he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From 
any witch or wizard? HeÕd almost be glad of a sight of his arch-
enemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadnÕt all been a dream. ...
Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very 
end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than 
Lord Vol de mort himself. Vol de mort might be a ruin of his former 
self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to re-
gain power. Harry had slipped through Vol de mortÕs clutches for a 
second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks 
later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, won-
dering where Vol de mort was now, remembering his livid face, his 
wide, mad eyes Ñ
Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had 
been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge Ñ
and the hedge was 
staring back.
 Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the 
leaves.
Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice ß oated across the 
lawn.
ÒI know what day it is,Ó sang Dudley, waddling toward him.

ÒWhat?Ó said Harry, not taking his eyes o

had been.
ÒI know what day it is,Ó Dudley repeated, coming right up to 
him.
ÒWell done,Ó said Harry. ÒSo youÕve Þ nally learned the days of 
the week.Ó
ÒTodayÕs your

,Ó sneered Dudley. ÒHow come you 
havenÕt got any cards? HavenÕt you even got friends at that freak 
place?Ó
ÒBetter not let your mum hear you talking about my school,Ó 
said Harry coolly.
Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his 
fat bottom.
ÒWhyÕre you staring at the hedge?Ó he said suspiciously.
ÒIÕm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on 
Þ re,Ó said Harry.
Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat 
face.
ÒYou c-canÕt ÑDad told you youÕre not to do m-magic Ñhe 
said heÕll chuck you out of the house Ñand you havenÕt got any-

ÒHocus pocus Ñ

ÒMUUUUUUM!Ó howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he 
dashed back toward the house. ÒMUUUUM! HeÕs doing you know 
what!Ó
Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor

10the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadnÕt really 
done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at 
his head with the soapy frying pan. 
!
 en she gave him work to do, 
with the promise he wouldnÕt eat again until heÕd Þ nished.
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, 
Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, 
trimmed the ß ower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and re-
painted the garden bench. 
!
 e sun blazed overhead, burning the 
back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldnÕt have risen to DudleyÕs 
bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking 
himself ... maybe he 
didnÕt
 have any friends at Hogwarts. ... 
Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now,
 he thought savagely 
as he spread manure on the ß ower beds, his back aching, sweat run-
ning down his face.
It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he 
heard Aunt Petunia calling him.
ÒGet in here! And walk on the newspaper!Ó
Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. 
On top of the fridge stood tonightÕs pudding: a huge mound of 
whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was siz-
zling in the oven.
ÒEat quickly! 
!
 e Masons will be here soon!Ó snapped Aunt Pe-
tunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on 
the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail 
dress.
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper.

moment he had Þ nished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. 
ÒUpstairs! Hurry!Ó

11As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse 
of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He 
had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang 
and Uncle VernonÕs furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.
ÒRemember, boy Ñone soundÑÓ
Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed 
the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.

H arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing.

 e little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and 
bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly 
that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge 
that morning.
As they stared at each other, Harry heard DudleyÕs voice from 
the hall.
ÒMay I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?Ó

 e creature slipped o

  the bed and bowed so low that the end 
of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was 
wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and 
leg-holes.
ÒEr Ñhello,Ó said Harry nervously.
ÒHarry Potter!Ó said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry 
was sure would carry down the stairs. ÒSo long has Dobby wanted 
to meet you, sir ... Such an honor it is....Ó

 -thank you,Ó said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking 
into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large 
cage. He wanted to ask, ÒWhat are you?Ó but thought it would 
sound too rude, so instead he said, ÒWho are you?Ó
ÒDobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,Ó said the crea-
ture.
ÒOh Ñreally?Ó said Harry. ÒEr ÑI donÕt want to be rude or 
anything, but Ñthis isnÕt a great time for me to have a house-elf

ÒNot that IÕm not pleased to meet you,Ó said Harry quickly, Òbut,

looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to con-
trol himself, and sat with his great eyes Þ xed on Harry in an ex-
pression of watery adoration.

started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, Ò

ÒDonÕt Ñwhat are you doing?Ó Harry hissed, springing up and 
pulling Dobby back onto the bed ÑHedwig had woken up with a 
particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against 
the bars of her cage.

slightly cross-eyed. ÒDobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir....Ó

grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his 
ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sirÑÓ
ÒBut wonÕt they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?Ó

one help you? CanÕt I?Ó
Almost at once, Harry wished he hadnÕt spoken. Dobby dis-
solved again into wails of gratitude.
ÒPlease,Ó Harry whispered frantically, Òplease be quiet. If the 
Dursleys hear anything, if they know youÕre hereÑÓ
ÒHarry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of 
your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew....Ó
Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, ÒWhat-
ever youÕve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. IÕm not 
even top of my year at Hogwarts; thatÕs Her mi one, sheÑÓ
But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Her mi one was 
painful.
ÒHarry Potter is humble and modest,Ó said Dobby reverently, his 
orb-like eyes aglow. ÒHarry Potter speaks not of his triumph over 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-NamedÑÓ

know what itÕs like here. I donÕt

ß apped. ÒHarry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, 
too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be

frantically against the wall.
ÒAll right!Ó cried Harry, grabbing the elfÕs arm to stop him. ÒYou 
canÕt tell me. I understand. But why are you warning

tilted worryingly close to the wall again.
Slowly, Dobby shook his head.
ÒNot Ñnot

But DobbyÕs eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give 
Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.
ÒHe hasnÕt got a brother, has he?Ó
Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.
ÒWell then, I canÕt think who else would have a chance of mak-
ing horrible things happen at Hogwarts,Ó said Harry. ÒI mean, 
thereÕs Dum ble dore, for one thing Ñyou know who Dum ble dore 
is, donÕt you?Ó
Dobby bowed his head.
ÒAlbus Dum ble dore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has 
ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dum ble doreÕs 
powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height 
of his strength. But, sirÓ ÑDobbyÕs voice dropped to an urgent 
whisper ÑÒthere are powers Dum ble dore doesnÕt ... powers no

And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded o

seized HarryÕs desk lamp, and started beating himself around the 
head with earsplitting yelps.
A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart 
thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling,

ÒHave you been stopping my letters?Ó

HarryÕs reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of 
the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Her mi oneÕs 
neat writing, RonÕs untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked 
as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.
ÒHarry Potter mustnÕt be angry. ... Dobby hoped ... if Harry 
Potter thought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter 
might not want to go back to school, sir....Ó
Harry wasnÕt listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby 
jumped out of reach.

Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom 
door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying 
not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike 
on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining 
room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, Ò...tell Petunia that very 
funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. SheÕs 
been dying to hear...Ó
Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach dis-
appear.
Aunt PetuniaÕs masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream 
and sugared violets, was ß oating up near the ceiling. On top of a 
cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.

20burst into the kitchen to Þ nd Harry, rigid with shock, covered from 
head to foot in Aunt PetuniaÕs pudding.
At Þ rst, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to 
gloss the whole thing over. (ÒJust our nephew Ñvery disturbedÑ
meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs....Ó) He 
shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised 
Harry he would ß ay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma-
sons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice 
cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing 
the kitchen clean.
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal Ñif it 
hadnÕt been for the owl.
Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner 
mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room 
window, dropped a letter on Mrs. MasonÕs head, and swooped out 
again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house 
shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell 
the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes 
and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke.
Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as 
Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.
ÒRead it!Ó he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had de-
livered. ÒGo on Ñread it!Ó
Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.
Dear Mr. Potter,

Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.
ÒYou didnÕt tell us you werenÕt allowed to use magic outside 
school,Ó said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. ÒFor-
got to mention it. ... Slipped your mind, I daresay....Ó
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth 
bared. ÒWell, IÕve got news for you, boy. ... IÕm locking you up. 
... YouÕre never going back to that school ... never ... and if you 
try and magic yourself out ÑtheyÕll expel you!Ó

be pushed inside three times a day.

bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his 
room around the clock.

 ree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, 
and Harry couldnÕt see any way out of his situation. He lay on his 
bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and 
wondered miserably what was going to happen to him.
What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if 
Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had 
reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they werenÕt 
going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby 
might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, 
but the way things were going, heÕd probably starve to death any-
way.

a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were 
aching with hunger, jumped o

stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp.

 en he crossed the 
room to HedwigÕs cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bot-
tom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ru
#
  ed her feathers 
and gave him a look of deep disgust.
ÒItÕs no good turning your beak up at it ÑthatÕs all weÕve got,Ó 
said Harry grimly.
He put the empty bowl back on the ß oor next to the cat-ß ap and 
lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had 
been before the soup.

23Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would 
happen if he didnÕt turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent 
to see why he hadnÕt come back? Would they be able to make the 
Dursleys let him go?

mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell 
into an uneasy sleep.
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading

 attached to his cage. People goggled through 
the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He 
saw DobbyÕs face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, 
but Dobby called, ÒHarry Potter is safe there, sir!Ó and vanished. 
!
 en the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the 
cage, laughing at him.
ÒStop it,Ó Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore 
head. ÒLeave me alone ... cut it out ... IÕm trying to sleep....Ó
He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on 
the window. And someone 
was
 goggling through the bars at him: a 
freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.
Ron Weasley was outside HarryÕs window.

it up so they could talk through the bars. ÒRon, how did

HarryÕs mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was see -

old turquoise car, which was parked 
in midair.
 Grinning at Harry 
from the front seats were Fred and George, RonÕs elder twin 
 brothers.
ÒAll right, Harry?Ó asked George.

me up and wonÕt let me come back, and obviously I canÕt magic

ÒStop gibbering,Ó said Ron. ÒWeÕve come to take you home 
with us.Ó
ÒBut you canÕt magic me out eitherÑÓ
ÒWe donÕt need to,Ó said Ron, jerking his head toward the front 
seat and grinning. ÒYou forget who IÕve got with me.Ó
ÒTie that around the bars,Ó said Fred, throwing the end of a rope 
to Harry.
ÒIf the Dursleys wake up, IÕm dead,Ó said Harry as he tied the 
rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
ÒDonÕt worry,Ó said Fred, Òand stand back.Ó
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who 
seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still 
and silent. 
!
 e car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a 
crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as 
Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to 
see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron 
hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there 
was no sound from the DursleysÕ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred re-
versed as close as possible to HarryÕs window.

Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into

George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to 
pick the lock.

back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.

ing them out of the window to Ron.

George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon 
cough.
At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk 
through HarryÕs room to the open window. Fred climbed back into 
the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the 
bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.
Uncle Vernon coughed again.

Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it 
slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.
ÒOkay, letÕs go,Ó George whispered.
But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden 
loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thun-
der of Uncle VernonÕs voice.
ÒTHAT RUDDY OWL!Ó
ÒIÕve forgotten Hedwig!Ó
Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked 
on Ñhe snatched up HedwigÕs cage, dashed to the window, and 
passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of 
drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door Ñ
and it crashed open.
For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; 
then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grab-
bing him by the ankle.
Ron, Fred, and George seized HarryÕs arms and pulled as hard 
as they could.
ÒPetunia!Ó roared Uncle Vernon. ÒHeÕs getting away! HEÕS 
GETTING AWAY!Ó

seat, grinning from ear to ear.
ÒLet Hedwig out,Ó he told Ron. ÒShe can ß y behind us. She 
hasnÕt had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.Ó
George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later,  Hedwig 
soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a 
ghost.

29ing back to Hogwarts. SomeoneÕs idea of a joke. Can you think of 
anyone at school with a grudge against you?Ó
ÒYes,Ó said Harry and Ron together, instantly.
ÒDraco Malfoy,Ó Harry explained. ÒHe hates me.Ó
ÒDraco Malfoy?Ó said George, turning around. ÒNot Lucius 
MalfoyÕs son?Ó
ÒMust be, itÕs not a very common name, is it?Ó said Harry. 
ÒWhy?Ó
ÒIÕve heard Dad talking about him,Ó said George. ÒHe was a big 
supporter of You-Know-Who.Ó
ÒAnd when You-Know-Who disappeared,Ó said Fred, craning 
around to look at Harry, ÒLucius Malfoy came back saying heÕd 
never meant any of it. Load of dung ÑDad reckons he was right 
in You-Know-WhoÕs inner circle.Ó
Harry had heard these rumors about MalfoyÕs family before, and 
they didnÕt surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look 
like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
ÒI donÕt know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf....Ó said 
Harry.
ÒWell, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and 
theyÕll be rich,Ó said Fred.
ÒYeah, MumÕs always wishing we had a house-elf to do the iron-
ing,Ó said George. ÒBut all weÕve got is a lousy old ghoul in the at-
tic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old 
manors and castles and places like that; you wouldnÕt catch one in 
our house....Ó

had the best of every thing, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he

ing the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts 
also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had 
Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
ÒIÕm glad we came to get you, anyway,Ó said Ron. ÒI was getting 
really worried when you didnÕt answer any of my letters. I thought 
it was ErrolÕs fault at Þ rstÑÓ
ÒWhoÕs Errol?Ó

ÒBut Percy wouldnÕt lend him to me,Ó said Ron. ÒSaid he needed 
him.Ó
ÒPercyÕs been acting very oddly this summer,Ó said George, 
frowning. ÒAnd he

 been sending a lot of letters and spending a 
load of time shut up in his room. ... I mean, thereÕs only so many 
times you can polish a prefect badge. ... YouÕre driv ing too far 
west, Fred,Ó he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. 
Fred twiddled the steering wheel.
ÒSo, does your dad know youÕve got the car?Ó said Harry, guess-
ing the answer.
ÒEr, no,Ó said Ron, Òhe had to work tonight. Hopefully weÕll be 
able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we ß ew it.Ó

ÒSo,Ó
 she said.

 And unless HarryÕs ears were deceiving him, 
the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up 
was ÒWitching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina 
Warbeck.Ó
Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little 
haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages 
into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like 
ÒdonÕt know

At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, red-
headed Þ gure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, 
gave a small squeal, and ran out again.
ÒGinny,Ó said Ron in an undertone to Harry. ÒMy sister. SheÕs

you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if thereÕs a single 
gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.Ó
Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with 
Harry behind them.

actly what a garden should be.

 e Dursleys wouldnÕt have liked 
itÑthere were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting Ñ
but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had 
never seen spilling from every ß ower bed, and a big green pond full 
of frogs.
ÒMuggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,Ó Harry told Ron 
as they crossed the lawn.
ÒYeah, IÕve seen those things they think are gnomes,Ó said Ron, 
bent double with his head in a peony bush, Òlike fat little Santa

It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leath-
ery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. 
Ron held it at armÕs length as it kicked out at him with its horny lit-
tle feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.
Ò
"
 is is what you have to do,Ó he said. He raised the gnome 
above his head (ÒGerro

  me!Ó) and started to swing it in great cir-
cles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on HarryÕs face, Ron 
added, ÒIt doesnÕt 
hurt
 them ÑyouÕve just got to make them really 
dizzy so they canÕt Þ nd their way back to the gnomeholes.Ó
He let go of the gnomeÕs ankles: It ß ew twenty feet into the air 
and landed with a thud in the Þ eld over the hedge.
ÒPitiful,Ó said Fred. ÒI bet I can get mine beyond that stump.Ó
Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He 
decided just to drop the Þ rst one he caught over the hedge, but the 
gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into HarryÕs 
Þ nger and he had a hard job shaking it o

ÒWow, Harry Ñthat mustÕve been Þ fty feet....Ó

gnomes at once. Ò

on they storm up to have a look. YouÕd think theyÕd have learned 
by now just to stay put.Ó
Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the Þ eld started walking away in 
a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.

pear into the hedge on the other side of the Þ eld. Ò

ÒHeÕs back!Ó said George. ÒDadÕs home!Ó

Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses o
"
  
and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little 
hair he had was as red as any of his childrenÕs. He was wearing long 
green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.
ÒWhat a night,Ó he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all 
sat down around him. ÒNine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus 
Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned....Ó
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.
ÒFind anything, Dad?Ó said Fred eagerly.

yawned Mr. Weasley. Ò

tioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but thatÕs the Commit-

ÒWhy would anyone bother making door keys shrink?Ó said 
George.
ÒJust Muggle-baiting,Ó sighed Mr. Weasley. ÒSell them a key that 
keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never Þ nd it when they 
need it. ... Of course, itÕs very hard to convict anyone because no 
Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking ÑtheyÕll insist 
they just keep losing it. Bless them, theyÕll go to any lengths to ig-
nore magic, even if itÕs staring them in the face. ... But the things

ÒLIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?Ó
Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. 
Mr. WeasleyÕs eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.

1chapter one
H arry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For 
one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any 
other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his home-
work but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he 
also happened to be a wizard.
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, 
the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a ß ashlight in 
one hand and a large leather-bound book (
A History of Magic
 by 
Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved 
the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he 
looked for something that would help him write his essay, ÒWitch 
Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely PointlessÑ
discuss.Ó 
!
 e quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry 
pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his ß ash-
light closer to the book, and read:

2chapter one
Non-magic people (more commonly known as 
Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medi-
eval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On 
the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or 
wizard, burning had no e
!
 ect whatsoever. 
"
 e witch 
or wizard would perform a basic Flame- Freezing 
Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while 
enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wen-
delin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that 
she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-
seven times in various disguises.
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath 
his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and 
very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, 
and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because 
if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way 
to the bathroom, heÕd probably Þ nd himself locked in the cup-
board under the stairs for the rest of the summer.
!
 e Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason 
that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, 
Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were HarryÕs only living rela-
tives. 
!
 ey were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude 
toward magic. HarryÕs dead parents, who had been a witch and 
wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the DursleysÕ roof. 
For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they 
kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to 
squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuc-
cessful.

Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
!
 e most they could do, however, was to 
lock away HarryÕs spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick 
at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the 
neighbors.
!
 is separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for 
Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of hol-
iday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrink-
ing potions, was for HarryÕs least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, 
who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry  detention 
for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the Þ rst week 
of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley 
had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle VernonÕs new 
company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street 
would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock 
on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and 
hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didnÕt leave spots of ink 
on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying 
magic by night.
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and 
uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad 
mood with him, all because heÕd received a telephone call from a 
fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.
Ron Weasley, who was one of HarryÕs best friends at Hogwarts, 
came from a whole family of wizards. 
!
 is meant that he knew a 
lot of things Harry didnÕt, but had never used a telephone before. 
Most unluckily, it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the 
call.

Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he 
heard RonÕs voice answer.
ÒHELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I ÑWANTÑ
TOÑTALK ÑTO ÑHARRY ÑPOTTER!Ó 
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held 
the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression 
of mingled fury and alarm.
ÒWHO IS THIS?Ó he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. 
ÒWHO ARE YOU?Ó 
ÒRON ÑWEASLEY!Ó Ron bellowed back, as though he and 
Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football Þ eld. 
ÒIÕM ÑA ÑFRIEND ÑOF ÑHARRYÕS ÑFROMÑ
SCHOOLÑÓ
Uncle VernonÕs small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was 
rooted to the spot.
ÒTHERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!Ó he roared, now 
holding the receiver at armÕs length, as though frightened it might 
explode. ÒI DONÕT KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOUÕRE TALK-
ING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DONÕT YOU 
COME NEAR MY FAMILY!Ó 
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if drop-
ping a poisonous spider.
!
 e Þ ght that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
ÒHOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE 
LIKE ÑPEOPLE LIKE 
YOU

ing Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that heÕd gotten Harry into trouble, 
 because he hadnÕt called again. HarryÕs other best friend from

 Hogwarts, Her mi one Granger, hadnÕt been in touch either. Harry 
suspected that Ron had warned Her mi one not to call, which was 
a pity, because Her mi one, the cleverest witch in HarryÕs year, had 
Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and 
would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to 
Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for 
Þ ve long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as 
bad as the last one. 
!
 ere was just one very small improvementÑ
after swearing that he wouldnÕt use her to send letters to any of his 
friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at 
night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig 
made if she was locked in her cage all the time.
Harry Þ nished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to 
listen again. 
!
 e silence in the dark house was broken only by the 
distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. 
It must be 
very late,
 Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Per-
haps heÕd Þ nish this essay tomorrow night. ... 
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase 
from under his bed; put the ß ashlight, 
A History of Magic,
 his essay, 
quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose 
ß oorboard under his bed. 
!
 en he stood up, stretched, and checked 
the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.
It was one oÕclock in the morning. HarryÕs stomach gave a funny 
jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a 
whole hour.
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked 
forward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in

his life. 
!
 e Dursleys had completely ignored his last two  birthdays, 
and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.
Harry walked across the dark room, past HedwigÕs large, empty 
cage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air 
pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig 
had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasnÕt worried about 
her: SheÕd been gone this long before. But he hoped sheÕd be back 
soon Ñshe was the only living creature in this house who didnÕt 
ß inch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had 
grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, 
was just as it always had been Ñstubbornly untidy, whatever he 
did to it. 
!
 e eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his 
forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped 
like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most ex-
traordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten 
years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed HarryÕs  parents, be-
cause Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. 
!
 ey had 
been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a 
hundred years, Lord Vol de mort. Harry had escaped from the same 
attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Vol de-
mortÕs curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its origi-
nator. Barely alive, Vol de mort had ß ed. ... 
But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Re-
membering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, 
Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thir-
teenth birthday.
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring

back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak,  expecting 
praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds be-
fore Harry realized what he was seeing.
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every 
moment, was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was ß ap-
ping in HarryÕs direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink 
lower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the 
window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then the 
 bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, 
and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.
!
 rough the window soared three owls, two of them holding up 
the third, which appeared to be unconscious. 
!
 ey landed with a 
soft 
ß ump
 on HarryÕs bed, and the middle owl, which was large and 
gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. 
!
 ere was a large pack-
age tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once Ñhis name 
was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed 
to the bed, untied the cords around ErrolÕs legs, took o
"
  the par-
cel, and then carried Errol to HedwigÕs cage. Errol opened one 
bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some 
water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the 
large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a 
parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry 
an a
"
 ectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then 
ß ew across the room to join Errol.
Harry didnÕt recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, 
but he knew at once where it had come from, because in addition 
to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the  Hogwarts

crest. When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ru

  ed its 
feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took o

window into the night.
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed ErrolÕs package, ripped 
o
"
  the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and 
his Þ rst-ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened 
the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out Ña letter and a news-
paper clipping.
#
 e clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, 
the 
Daily Prophet
, because the people in the black-and-white pic-
ture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, 
and read:

tifacts O

#
 e Weasley family will be spending a month 
in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school 
year at Hogwarts, which Þ ve of the Weasley chil-
dren currently attend.
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across 
his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him,

tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though 
the black-and-white picture didnÕt show it) with ß aming-red hair. 
Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with 
his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little 
sister, Ginny.
Harry couldnÕt think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile 
of gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely 
poor. He picked up RonÕs letter and unfolded it.
Dear Harry,
Happy birthday!
Look, IÕm really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the 
Muggles didnÕt give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he 
reckons I shouldnÕt have shouted.

Try and come to London,
P.S. PercyÕs Head Boy. He got the letter last week.
Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his sev-
enth and Þ nal year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He 
had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of 
his neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses ß ashing in the Egyptian sun.
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was 
what looked like a miniature glass spinning top. 
!
 ere was another 
note from Ron beneath it.
Harry Ñthis is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If thereÕs  someone 
untrustworthy around, itÕs supposed to light up and spin. Bill 
says itÕs rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isnÕt reliable, 
 because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didnÕt 
realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.
Bye Ñ
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where 
it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reß ecting the luminous 
hands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then 
picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought.

Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, 
this time from Her mi one.
Dear Harry,
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your 
Uncle Vernon. I do hope youÕre all right.
IÕm on holiday in France at the moment and I didnÕt 
know how I was going to send this to you Ñwhat if theyÕd 
opened it at customs? Ñbut then Hedwig turned up! I 
think she wanted to make sure you got something for your 
birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; 
there was an advertisement in the 
Daily Prophet
 (IÕve 
been  getting it delivered; itÕs so good to keep up with whatÕs 
 going on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture 
of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet heÕs learning loads. 
IÕm really  jealous Ñthe ancient Egyp tian wizards were fas-
cinating.
! ereÕs some interesting local history of witchcraft here, 
too. IÕve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include 
some of the things IÕve found out. I hope itÕs not too long Ñ
itÕs two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked 
for.
Ron says heÕs going to be in London in the last week of the 
holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you 
come? I really hope you can. If not, IÕll see you on the  Hogwarts 
Express on September Þ rst!

P.S. Ron says PercyÕs Head Boy. IÕll bet PercyÕs really pleased. 
Ron doesnÕt seem too happy about it.
Harry laughed as he put Her mi oneÕs letter aside and picked up 
her present. It was very heavy. Knowing Her mi one, he was sure it 
would be a large book full of very di
!
  cult spells Ñbut it wasnÕt. 
His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a 
sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading 
Broomstick Servicing Kit
.ÒWow, Her mi one!Ó Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look 
inside.
"
 ere was a large jar of FleetwoodÕs High-Finish Handle Polish, 
a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass 
to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-
Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about 
Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical 
world Ñhighly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broom-
sticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had 
been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the 
Hogwarts House teams. One of HarryÕs most prized possessions 
was his Nimbus Two 
"
 ousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He 
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: 
"

was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore o
#
  the top 
layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but be-
fore he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, 
and whatever was inside it snapped loudly Ñas though it had 
jaws.

Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him any-
thing dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didnÕt have a  normal 
personÕs view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to 
befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in 
pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry 
reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it Þ rmly in one 
hand, and raised it over his head, ready to strike.

 en he seized the 
rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.
And out fell Ña book. Harry just had time to register its hand-
some green cover, emblazoned with the golden title

, before it ß ipped onto its edge and scuttled side-
ways along the bed like some weird crab.
ÒUh-oh,Ó Harry muttered.

were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and 
reached toward it.
ÒOuch!Ó

still scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw him-
self forward, and managed to ß atten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, 
sleepy grunt in the room next door.
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the 
struggling book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of draw-
ers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it.

Happy birthday!

It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book 
would come in useful, but he put HagridÕs card up next to RonÕs 
and Her mi oneÕs, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was 
only the letter from Hogwarts left.
Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open 
the envelope, pulled out the Þ rst page of parchment within, and 
read:

ber the Þ rst.

Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at 
it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade 
on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he 
had never set foot there. But how on earth was he going to per-
suade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two oÕclock in the

H arry went down to breakfast the next morning to Þ nd the 
three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table.

 ey were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-
the- summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly 
about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the 
living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, 
his piggy little eyes Þ xed on the screen and his Þ ve chins wobbling 
as he ate continually.
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, 
beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from 
wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any 
sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far 
too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and 
then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway 
through a report on an escaped convict:

ÒNo need to tell us

over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. ÒLook at the state of 
him, the Þ lthy layabout! Look at his hair!Ó 
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had 
always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Com-
pared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was 
surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well 
groomed indeed.

ÒHang on!Ó barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the re-
porter. ÒYou didnÕt tell us where that maniacÕs escaped from! What 
use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!Ó 
Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around 
and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt 
Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line num-
ber. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her 
life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors.
ÒWhen will they 
learn,
Ó said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table 
with his large purple Þ st, Òthat hangingÕs the only way to deal with 
these people?Ó 
ÒVery true,Ó said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next

Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the  Broomstick Ser-
vicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.
ÒAunt Marge?Ó he blurted out. ÒSh Ñ
sheÕs
 not coming here, is 
she?Ó 
Aunt Marge was Uncle VernonÕs sister. Even though she was not 
a blood relative of HarryÕs (whose mother had been Aunt Petu-
niaÕs sister), he had been forced to call her ÒAuntÓ all his life. Aunt 
Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where 
she bred bulldogs. She didnÕt often stay at Privet Drive, because she 
couldnÕt bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood 
out horribly vividly in HarryÕs mind.
At DudleyÕs Þ fth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked 
Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from 
beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned 
up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box 
of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry 
started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of 
her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and 
up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him o
!
  until past 
midnight. 
"
 e memory of this incident still brought tears of laugh-
ter to DudleyÕs eyes.
ÒMargeÕll be here for a week,Ó Uncle Vernon snarled, Òand while 
weÕre on the subjectÓÑhe pointed a fat Þ nger threateningly at 
HarryÑÒwe need to get a few things straight before I go and col-
lect her.Ó 
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. 
Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was DudleyÕs 
 favorite form of entertainment.

ÒFirstly,Ó growled Uncle Vernon, ÒyouÕll keep a civil tongue in 
your head when youÕre talking to Marge.Ó 
ÒAll right,Ó said Harry bitterly, Òif she does when sheÕs talking 
to me.Ó 
ÒSecondly,Ó said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not 
heard HarryÕs reply, Òas Marge doesnÕt know anything about your 
abnormality,

  while sheÕs here. 
You behave yourself, got me?Ó 
ÒI will if she does,Ó said Harry through gritted teeth.
ÒAnd thirdly,Ó said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits 
in his great purple face, ÒweÕve told Marge you attend St. BrutusÕs 
Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó 
Harry yelled.
ÒAnd youÕll be sticking to that story, boy, or thereÕll be trouble,Ó 
spat Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle 
 Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a week-
long visitÑit was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had 
ever given him, including that pair of Uncle VernonÕs old socks.
ÒWell, Petunia,Ó said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet,

Petunia, smoothing DudleyÕs thick blond hair. ÒMummyÕs bought 
him a lovely new bow tie.Ó 
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.

ÒSee you in a bit, then,Ó he said, and he left the kitchen.
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horriÞ ed trance, had a 
sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and 
followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.
Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.
ÒIÕm not taking

ÒSo?Ó snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook 
next to the door.
ÒI need you to sign the permission form,Ó said Harry in a rush.
ÒAnd why should I do that?Ó sneered Uncle Vernon.
ÒWell,Ó said Harry, choosing his words carefully, ÒitÕll be hard 
work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. WhatsitsÑÓ
ÒSt. BrutusÕs Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!Ó bel-
lowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a deÞ nite note 
of panic in Uncle VernonÕs voice.
ÒExactly,Ó said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle VernonÕs 
large, purple face. ÒItÕs a lot to remember. IÕll have to make it sound 
convincing, wonÕt I? What if I accidentally let something slip?Ó 
ÒYouÕll get the stu

Uncle Vernon stopped, his Þ st still raised, his face an ugly 
puce.
ÒBut if you sign my permission form,Ó Harry went on quickly, 
ÒI swear IÕll remember where IÕm supposed to go to school, and IÕll 
act like a Mug Ñlike IÕm normal and everything.Ó 
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if 
his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
ÒRight,Ó he snapped Þ nally. ÒI shall monitor your behavior care-
fully during MargeÕs visit. If, at the end of it, youÕve toed the line 
and kept to the story, IÕll sign your ruddy form.Ó 
He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it 
so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.
Harry didnÕt return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to 
his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, heÕd  better 
start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his 
birthday cards and hid them under the loose ß oorboard with his 
homework.

 en he went to HedwigÕs cage. Errol seemed to have 
recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their 
wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.
ÒHedwig,Ó he said gloomily, ÒyouÕre going to have to clear o

be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Her mi one.Ó 
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron 
bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, 
now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside 
the wardrobe.
But Harry didnÕt have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt

Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and 
get ready to welcome their guest.
ÒDo something about your hair!Ó Aunt Petunia snapped as he 
reached the hall.
Harry couldnÕt see the point of trying to make his hair lie ß at. 
Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the 
happier she would be.
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle 
 VernonÕs car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the 
car doors and footsteps on the garden path.
ÒGet the door!Ó Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door 
open.
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle 
Vernon: Large, beefy, and purple-faced, she even had a mustache, 
though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous 
suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered 
bulldog.
ÒWhereÕs my Dudders?Ó roared Aunt Marge. ÒWhereÕs my ne

Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered 
ß at to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. 
Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into HarryÕs stomach, knocking 
the wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and 
planted a large kiss on his cheek.
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt 
MargeÕs hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, 
when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note 
clutched in his fat Þ st.

ÒPetunia!Ó shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though 
he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, 
Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt PetuniaÕs bony 
cheekbone.
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.
ÒTea, Marge?Ó he said. ÒAnd what will Ripper take?Ó 
ÒRipper can have some tea out of my saucer,Ó said Aunt Marge 
as they all trooped into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the 
hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasnÕt complaining; any excuse 
not to be with Aunt Marge was Þ ne by him, so he began to heave 
the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he 
could.
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been 
supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in 
the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea 
and drool ß ecked her clean ß oor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.
ÒWhoÕs looking after the other dogs, Marge?Ó Uncle Vernon 
asked.

Harry was bursting to say that heÕd rather live in an orphanage 
than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form 
stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.
ÒDonÕt you smirk at me!Ó boomed Aunt Marge. ÒI can see 
you havenÕt improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would 
knock some manners into you.Ó She took a large gulp of tea, wiped 
her mustache, and said, ÒWhere is it that you send him, again, 
 Vernon?Ó 
ÒSt. BrutusÕs,Ó said Uncle Vernon promptly. ÒItÕs a Þ rst-rate 
 institution for hopeless cases.Ó 
ÒI see,Ó said Aunt Marge. ÒDo they use the cane at St. BrutusÕs,

ÒYes,Ó said Harry.

properly, he added, ÒAll the time.Ó 
ÒExcellent,Ó said Aunt Marge. ÒI wonÕt have this namby-pamby, 
wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A 
good thrashing is whatÕs needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hun-

ÒOh, yeah,Ó said Harry, Òloads of times.Ó 
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.
ÒI still donÕt like your tone, boy,Ó she said. ÒIf you can speak of 
your beatings in that casual way, they clearly arenÕt hitting you 
hard enough. Petunia, IÕd write if I were you. Make it clear that 
you approve the use of extreme force in this boyÕs case.Ó 
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their 
bargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.

ÒHeard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped 
prisoner, eh?Ó 
As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught him-
self thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay 
out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt 
Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, 
so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. She 
delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge plea-
sure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as 
though daring him to ask why he hadnÕt got a present too. She also 
kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an un-
satisfactory person.
ÒYou mustnÕt blame yourself for the way the boyÕs turned out, 
Vernon,Ó she said over lunch on the third day. ÒIf thereÕs something 
rotten on the

At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding ex-
ploded in her hand. Shards of glass ß ew in every direction and 
Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.

But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry 
suspiciously, so he decided heÕd better skip dessert and escape from 
the table as soon as he could.
Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply.

stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic

Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face

and a bit more ... thatÕs the ticket.Ó
Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sip-

to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle VernonÕs angry

empty brandy glass back down. ÒExcellent nosh, Petunia. ItÕs nor-

after....Ó She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. 
ÒPardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,Ó she went on, 
winking at Dudley. ÒYouÕll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like 
your father. Yes, IÕll have a spot more brandy, Vernon....

ÒHe ÑdidnÕt work,Ó said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at 
Harry. ÒUnemployed.Ó

But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it 
looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling 
with inexpressible anger Ñbut the swelling didnÕt stop. Her great

stretched too tightly for speech Ñnext second, several buttons had

eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into 
the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding 
into the room, barking madly.
ÒNOOOOOOO!Ó 
Uncle Vernon seized one of MargeÕs feet and tried to pull her 
down again, but was almost lifted from the ß oor himself. A second 
later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle VernonÕs 
leg.
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, 
heading for the cupboard under the stairs.

 e cupboard door 
burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his 
trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself

 under the bed, wrenching up the loose ß oorboard, and grabbed the 
pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, 
seized HedwigÕs empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his 
trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trou-
ser leg in bloody tatters.
ÒCOME BACK IN HERE!Ó he bellowed. ÒCOME BACK 
AND PUT HER RIGHT!Ó 
But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk 
open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.
ÒShe deserved it,Ó Harry said, breathing very fast. ÒShe deserved 
what she got. You keep away from me.Ó 
He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.
ÒIÕm going,Ó Harry said. ÒIÕve had enough.Ó 
And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, 
heaving his heavy trunk behind him, HedwigÕs cage under his arm.

of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through 
him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart.
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion 
overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never 
been in a worse Þ x. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Mug-
gle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, 
he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost 
certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for 
the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised 
Ministry of Magic representatives werenÕt swooping down on him 
where he sat.
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent. 
What was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would

he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of 
Ron and Her mi one, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure 
that, criminal or not, Ron and Her mi one would want to help him 
now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no 
means of contacting them.
He didnÕt have any Muggle money, either. 
!
 ere was a little wiz-
ard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest 
of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at 
 Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. HeÕd never be able to drag 
his trunk all the way to London. Unless ...  
He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in 
his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was now thump-
ing painfully fast), a bit more magic couldnÕt hurt. He had the 
Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father Ñwhat if he 
 bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broom-
stick, covered himself in the cloak, and ß ew to London? 
!
 en he 
could get the rest of his money out of his vault and ... begin his 
life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldnÕt sit on 
this wall forever, or heÕd Þ nd himself trying to explain to Muggle 
police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spell-
books and a broomstick.
Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, 
looking for the Invisibility Cloak Ñbut before he had found it, he 
straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel 
he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and 
no lights shone from any of the large square houses.
He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up 
once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather

than heard it: Someone or something was standing in the narrow 
gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted 
at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then heÕd know 
whether it was just a stray cat or Ñsomething else.
ÒLumos,Ó
 Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his 
wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the 
pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage 
door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the 
hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. 
His wand ß ew out of his hand as he ß ung out an arm to break his 
fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter Ñ

 ere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to 
shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light Ñ
With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A 
second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to 
a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying.

 ey belonged, as 
Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently 
purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over 
the windshield spelled

 e Knight Bus.
For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly 
by his fall.

 en a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the 
bus and began to speak loudly to the night.
ÒWelcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the 
stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on 
board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is 
Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eveÑÓ

 e conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of 
Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his

wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan 
Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nine-
teen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
ÒWhat were you doinÕ down there?Ó said Stan, dropping his pro-
fessional manner.
ÒFell over,Ó said Harry.
ÒÕChoo fall over for?Ó sniggered Stan.
ÒI didnÕt do it on purpose,Ó said Harry, annoyed. One of the 
knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to 
break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had 
fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway be-
tween the garage and fence.

 e Knight BusÕs headlamps were 
ß ooding it with light, and it was empty.
ÒÕChoo lookinÕ at?Ó said Stan.

into the gap. ÒLike a dog ... but massive...Ó
He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. 
With a feeling of unease, Harry saw StanÕs eyes move to the scar on 
 HarryÕs forehead.
ÒWoss that on your Õead?Ó said Stan abruptly.
ÒNothing,Ó said Harry quickly, ß attening his hair over his scar. 
If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didnÕt want to 
make it too easy for them.
ÒWoss your name?Ó Stan persisted.
ÒNeville Longbottom,Ó said Harry, saying the Þ rst name that 
came into his head. ÒSo Ñso this bus,Ó he went on quickly, hoping 
to distract Stan, Òdid you say it goes

ÒEleven Sickles,Ó said Stan, Òbut for Þ rteen you get Õot chocolate, 
and for Þ fteen you get an Õot water bottle anÕ a toofbrush in the

Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money 
bag, and shoved some silver into StanÕs hand. He and Stan then 
lifted his trunk, with HedwigÕs cage balanced on top, up the steps 
of the bus.
!
 ere were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood 
beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets 
beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wiz-
ard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, ÒNot now, thanks, 
IÕm pickling some slugsÓ and rolled over in his sleep.
ÒYou Õave this one,Ó Stan whispered, shoving HarryÕs trunk un-
der the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair 
in front of the steering wheel. Ò

ded to Harry, who nervously ß attened his bangs again and sat 
down on his bed.

next to ErnieÕs.

speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of

ÒWhere are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?Ó 
ÒAr,Ó said Ernie.
ÒHow come the Muggles donÕt hear the bus?Ó said Harry.

they? DonÕ look properly either. Never notice nu

ÒBest go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,Ó said Ern. ÒWeÕll be in 
Abergavenny in a minute.Ó 
Stan passed HarryÕs bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden 
staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling in-
creasingly nervous. Ernie didnÕt seem to have mastered the use of a 
steering wheel. 
"
 e Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but 
it didnÕt hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans 
jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once 
it had passed.
Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch 
wrapped in a traveling cloak.
ÒÕEre you go, Madam Marsh,Ó said Stan happily as Ern stamped 
on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the 
bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tot-
tered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed 
the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thun-
dering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.
Harry wouldnÕt have been able to sleep even if he had been 
traveling on a bus that didnÕt keep banging loudly and jumping 
a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back

to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the 
Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge o

Stan had unfurled a copy of the

 and was now 
reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a 
sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry 
from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.

"

ÒHe was on the Muggle news!Ó 
Stan turned to the front page and chuckled.
ÒSirius Black,Ó he said, nodding. ÒÕCourse Õe was on the Muggle 
news, Neville, where you been?Ó 
He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on HarryÕs 
face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.
ÒYou oughta read the papers more, Neville.Ó 
Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:
BLACK STILL AT LARGE
Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner 
ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding 
capture, the Ministry of Magic conÞ rmed today.
ÒWe are doing all we can to recapture Black,Ó 
said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this 
morning, Òand we beg the magical community to 
remain calm.Ó 
Fudge has been criticized by some members of 
the International Federation of Warlocks for in-
forming the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.
ÒWell, really, I had to, donÕt you know,Ó said an 
03_Knight Bus.indd   37

38chapter three
 irritable Fudge. ÒBlack is mad. HeÕs a danger to any-
one who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the 
Prime MinisterÕs assurance that he will not breathe 
a word of BlackÕs true identity to anyone. And letÕs 
face it ÑwhoÕd believe him if he did?Ó 
While Muggles have been told that Black is car-
rying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use 
to kill each other), the magical community lives in 
fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when 
Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.
Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only 
part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a 
vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against 
the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked 
just like one.
ÒScary-lookinÕ Þ ng, inee?Ó said Stan, who had been watching 
Harry read.
ÒHe murdered 
thirteen people

back to Stan, Òwith 
one curse
?ÓÒYep,Ó said Stan, Òin front of witnesses anÕ all. Broad daylight. 
Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?Ó 
ÒAr,Ó said Ern darkly.
Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better 
to look at Harry.
ÒBlack woz a big supporter of You-Know-ÕOo,Ó he said.
ÒWhat, Vol de mort?Ó said Harry, without thinking.

ÒYou outta your tree?Ó yelped Stan. ÒÕChoo say Õis name for?Ó

ÒForgot!Ó said Stan weakly. ÒBlimey, my ÕeartÕs goinÕ that

ÒSo Ñso Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?Ó Harry 
prompted apologetically.
ÒYeah,Ó said Stan, still rubbing his chest. ÒYeah, thatÕs right. Very 
close to You-Know-ÕOo, they say. Anyway, when little ÕArry Potter

didnÕt know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone 
heÕd ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, 
the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last 
year. Harry wouldnÕt soon forget the look of terror on HagridÕs face 
when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of 
the bravest people Harry knew.

beaming at Harry, while ErnieÕs owlish face peered interestedly 
over StanÕs shoulder.
ÒAnd a 
private
 parlor, please, Tom,Ó said Fudge pointedly.
ÒÕBye,Ó Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned 
Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.
ÒÕBye, Neville!Ó called Stan.
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after TomÕs 
 lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his Þ ngers, a Þ re 
burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.
ÒSit down, Harry,Ó said Fudge, indicating a chair by the Þ re.
Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite 
the glow of the Þ re. Fudge took o
!
  his pinstriped cloak and tossed 
it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat 
down opposite Harry.
ÒI am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. 
"
 e Minister of Magic.Ó 
Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once be-
fore, but as he had been wearing his fatherÕs Invisibility Cloak at 
the time, Fudge wasnÕt to know that.
Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his night-
shirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on 
a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the 
door behind him.
ÒWell, Harry,Ó said Fudge, pouring out tea, ÒyouÕve had us all in 
a right ß ap, I donÕt mind telling you. Running away from your aunt 
and uncleÕs house like that! IÕd started to think ... but youÕre safe, 
and thatÕs what matters.Ó 
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward 
Harry.

ÒEat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then ... You 
will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate 
 blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Ac-
cidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a 
few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory 
has been modiÞ ed. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So 
thatÕs that, and no harm done.Ó 
Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an 
uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldnÕt believe his 
ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldnÕt think of anything to say, 
and closed it again.
ÒAh, youÕre worrying about the reaction of your aunt and un-
cle?Ó said Fudge. ÒWell, I wonÕt deny that they are extremely angry, 
Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long 
as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.Ó 
Harry unstuck his throat.
ÒI 
always
 stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holi-
days,Ó he said, Òand I donÕt ever want to go back to Privet Drive.Ó 
ÒNow, now, IÕm sure youÕll feel di

It didnÕt occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting 
to hear what was going to happen to him now.
ÒSo all that remains,Ó said Fudge, now buttering himself a sec-
ond crumpet, Òis to decide where youÕre going to spend the last 
three weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the 
Leaky Cauldron andÑÓ

ÒHang on,Ó blurted Harry. ÒWhat about my punishment?Ó 
Fudge blinked.
ÒPunishment?Ó 
ÒI broke the law!Ó Harry said. Ò

 e Decree for the Restriction of 
Underage Wizardry!Ó 
ÒOh, my dear boy, weÕre not going to punish you for a little 
thing like that!Ó cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. ÒIt 
was an accident! We donÕt send people to Azkaban just for blowing 
up their aunts!Ó 
But this didnÕt tally at all with HarryÕs past dealings with the 
Ministry of Magic.
ÒLast year, I got an o
"
  cial warning just because a house-elf 
smashed a pudding in my uncleÕs house!Ó he told Fudge, frown-
ing. Ò
!
 e Ministry of Magic said IÕd be expelled from Hogwarts if 
there was any more magic there!Ó 
Unless HarryÕs eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly 
looking awkward.
ÒCircumstances change, Harry. ... We have to take into ac-
count ... in the present climate ... Surely you donÕt 
want
 to be 
expelled?Ó 
ÒOf course I donÕt,Ó said Harry.
ÒWell then, whatÕs all the fuss about?Ó laughed Fudge. ÒNow, 
have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if TomÕs got a room for 
you.Ó 
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. 
!
 ere 
was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been wait-
ing for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what 
heÕd done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasnÕt

usual for the Minister of Magic 
himself
 to get involved in matters 
of underage magic?
Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.
ÒRoom elevenÕs free, Harry,Ó said Fudge. ÒI think youÕll be very 
comfortable. Just one thing, and IÕm sure youÕll understand ... I 
donÕt want you wandering o
!
  into Muggle London, all right? Keep 
to Diagon Alley. And youÕre to be back here before dark each night. 
Sure youÕll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.Ó 
ÒOkay,Ó said Harry slowly, Òbut why Ñ?Ó
ÒDonÕt want to lose you again, do we?Ó said Fudge with a hearty 
laugh. ÒNo, no ... best we know where you are. ... I mean...Ó
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped 
cloak.
ÒWell, IÕll be o

 , plenty to do, you know....Ó
ÒHave you had any luck with Black yet?Ó Harry asked.
FudgeÕs Þ nger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.
ÒWhatÕs that? Oh, youÕve heard Ñwell, no, not yet, but itÕs only 
a matter of time. 
"
 e Azkaban guards have never yet failed ... and 
they are angrier than IÕve ever seen them.Ó
Fudge shuddered slightly.
ÒSo, IÕll say good-bye.Ó 
He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
ÒEr ÑMinister? Can I ask you something?Ó
ÒCertainly,Ó said Fudge with a smile.
ÒWell, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, 
but my aunt and uncle didnÕt sign the permission form. DÕyou 
think you could Ñ?Ó 
Fudge was looking uncomfortable.

ÒAh,Ó he said. ÒNo, no, IÕm very sorry, Harry, but as IÕm not your 
parent or guardianÑÓ
ÒBut youÕre the Minister of Magic,Ó said Harry eagerly. ÒIf you 
gave me permissionÑÓ
ÒNo, IÕm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,Ó said Fudge ß atly. 
ÒPerhaps youÕll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I

And with a last smile and shake of HarryÕs hand, Fudge left the 
room. Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.
ÒIf youÕll follow me, Mr. Potter,Ó he said, ÒIÕve already taken 
your things up....Ó
Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door 
with a brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened 
for him.
Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished 
oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling Þ re and, perched on top of the 
wardrobe Ñ

Hedwig.

only a few hours ago, that he wasnÕt expelled, and that he was now 
facing three completely Dursley-free weeks.

And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto 
his pillows and fell asleep.

Hogwarts this year, an event involving two 
other rival schools of magic, and a competition 
that hasnÕt happened for a hundred years. He 
wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. 
Unfortunately for Harry Potter, heÕs not normal Ñ
even by Wizarding standards. 
And in his case, different can be deadly.

HARRY POTTER
AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE
 ROWLING



he villagers of Little Hangleton still called it Òthe Riddle 
House,Ó even though it had been many years since the Rid-
dle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the 
 village, 
some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy 
spreading unchecked over its face. Once a Þne-looking manor, and 
easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Rid-
dle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.
!
e Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was Òcreepy.Ó 
Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened 
there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked 
to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. 
!
e story had been 
picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many 
places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. 
Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty 
years before, at daybreak on a Þne summerÕs morning, when the 


Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had 
entered the drawing room to Þnd all three Riddles dead.
!
e maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and 
roused as many people as she could.
ÒLying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their 
dinner things!Ó
!
e police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton 
had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. 
Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the 
Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. 
Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, 
Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about 
was the identity of their murderer
 Ñfor plainly, three apparently 
healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same 
night.
!
e Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that 
night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the 
murders. 
!
ey were rewarded for leaving their Þresides when the 
RiddlesÕ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced 
to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just 
been arrested.
ÒFrank!Ó cried several people. ÒNever!Ó
Frank Bryce was the RiddlesÕ gardener. He lived alone in a run-
down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had 
come back from the war with a very sti
" leg and a great dislike of 
crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever 
since.
!
ere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.
ÒAlways thought he was odd,Ó she told the eagerly listening vil-

lagers, after her fourth sherry. ÒUnfriendly, like. IÕm sure if IÕve 
o
"
ered him a cuppa once, IÕve o
"
ered it a hundred times. Never 
wanted to mix, he didnÕt.Ó
ÒAh, now,Ó said a woman at the bar, Òhe had a hard war, Frank. 
He likes the quiet life. 
!
atÕs no reason toÑÓ
ÒWho else had a key to the back door, then?Ó barked the cook. 
Ò
!
ereÕs been a spare key hanging in the gardenerÕs cottage far back 
as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken 
windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while 
we was all sleeping....Ó
!
e villagers exchanged dark looks.
ÒI always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,Ó 
grunted a man at the bar.
ÒWar turned him funny, if you ask me,Ó said the landlord.
ÒTold you I wouldnÕt like to get on the wrong side of Frank, 
didnÕt I, Dot?Ó said an excited woman in the corner.
ÒHorrible temper,Ó said Dot, nodding fervently. ÒI remember, 
when he was a kid...Ó
By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton 
doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.
But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the 
dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, 
again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he 
had seen near the house on the day of the RiddlesÕ deaths had been 
a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the 
village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that 
Frank had invented him.
!
en, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the 
report on the RiddlesÕ bodies came back and changed everything.

!
e police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors 
had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Rid-
dles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, su
"
ocated, or (as 
far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, 
in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared 
to be in perfect health
 Ñapart from the fact that they were all 
dead. 
!
e doctors did note (as though determined to Þnd some-
thing wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look 
of terror upon his or her face
 Ñbut as the frustrated police said, 
whoever heard of three people being 
frightened
 to death?
As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, 
the police were forced to let Frank go. 
!
e Riddles were buried in 
the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects 
of curiosity for a while. To everyoneÕs surprise, and amid a cloud of 
suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the 
Riddle House.
ÒÕS far as IÕm concerned, he killed them, and I donÕt care what 
the police say,Ó said Dot in the Hanged Man. ÒAnd if he had any 
decency, heÕd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.Ó
But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the 
next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the nextÑ
for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of 
Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about 
the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into 
disrepair.
!
e wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither 
lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept 
it for Òtax reasons,Ó though nobody was very clear what these might 

be. 
!
e wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the garden-
ing, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, 
very deaf, his bad leg sti
"
er than ever, but could be seen pottering 
around the ßower beds in Þne weather, even though the weeds were 
starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.
Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with 
 either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones 
through the windows of the Riddle House. 
!
ey rode their bicycles 
over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or 
twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. 
!
ey knew that old 
FrankÕs devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an 
obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the gar-
den, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for 
his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their 
parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank 
awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the 
old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step fur-
ther in their attempts to punish him.
It was FrankÕs bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse 
than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the 
kitchen with the idea of reÞlling his hot-water bottle to ease the 
sti
"
ness in his knee. Standing at the sink, Þlling the kettle, he 
looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its 
upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. 
!
e boys 
had broken into the house again, and judging by the ßickering 
quality of the light, they had started a Þre.
Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mis-
trusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning 
about the RiddlesÕ deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried 

back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back 
in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from 
its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was 
propped against the wall, and set o
" into the night.
!
e front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being 
forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the 
back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hid-
den by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened 
the door noiselessly.
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not en-
tered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he 
remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his 
way toward it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for 
any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the 
hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned win-
dows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the 
stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it 
mu
#
ed the sound of his feet and stick.
On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the 
intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, 
and a ßickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of 
gold across the black ßoor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping 
his walking stick Þrmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able 
to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
!
e Þre, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. 
!
is surprised 
him. 
!
en he stopped moving and listened intently, for a manÕs 
voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.
Ò
!
ere is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still 
hungry.Ó

ÒLater,Ó said a second voice. 
!
is too belonged to a man
 Ñbut 
it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy 
wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on 
the back of FrankÕs neck stand up. ÒMove me closer to the Þre, 
Wormtail.Ó
Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. 
!
ere came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard 
surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being 
dragged across the ßoor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, 
his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was 
 wearing a 
long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. 
!
en he went out of sight again.
ÒWhere is Nagini?Ó said the cold voice.
ÒI ÑI donÕt know, my Lord,Ó said the Þrst voice nervously. ÒShe 
set out to explore the house, I think....Ó
ÒYou will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,Ó said the second 
voice. ÒI will need feeding in the night. 
!
e journey has tired me 
greatly.Ó
Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the 
door, listening very hard. 
!
ere was a pause, and then the man 
called Wormtail spoke again.
ÒMy Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?Ó
ÒA week,Ó said the cold voice. ÒPerhaps longer. 
!
e place is mod-
erately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be 
foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.Ó
Frank inserted a gnarled Þnger into his ear and rotated it. Ow-
ing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word 
ÒQuidditch,Ó which was not a word at all.
Ò!
e Ñthe Quidditch World Cup, my Lord?Ó said Wormtail.  

(Frank dug his Þnger still more vigorously into his ear.) ÒForgive 
me, but
 ÑI do not understand
 Ñwhy should we wait until the 
World Cup is over?Ó
ÒBecause, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the 
country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Min-
istry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual 
activity, checking and double-checking identities. 
!
ey will be 
obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we 
wait.Ó
Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard 
the words ÒMinistry of Magic,Ó Òwizards,Ó and ÒMuggles.Ó Plainly, 
each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could 
think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies 
and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once 
more, and listened more closely still.
ÒYour Lordship is still determined, then?Ó Wormtail said quietly.
ÒCertainly I am determined, Wormtail.Ó 
!
ere was a note of 
menace in the cold voice now.
A slight pause followed
 Ñand then Wormtail spoke, the words 
tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to 
say this before he lost his nerve.
ÒIt could be done without Harry Potter, my Lord.Ó
Another pause, more protracted, and then
 ÑÒWithout Harry Potter?Ó breathed the second voice softly. ÒI 
see...Ó
ÒMy Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!Ó said 
Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. Ò
!
e boy is nothing to me, 
nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or 

wizard
 Ñany wizard
 Ñthe thing could be done so much more 
quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while
 Ñyou 
know that I can disguise myself most e
"
ectively
 ÑI could be back 
here in as little as two days with a suitable personÑÓ
ÒI could use another wizard,Ó said the cold voice softly, Òthat is 
true....Ó
ÒMy Lord, it makes sense,Ó said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly 
relieved now. ÒLaying hands on Harry Potter would be so di
$
cult, 
he is so well protectedÑÓ
ÒAnd so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I won-
der ... perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for 
you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be 
nothing more than an attempt to desert me?Ó
ÒMy Lord! I
 ÑI have no wish to leave you, none at allÑÓ
ÒDo not lie to me!Ó
 hissed the second voice. ÒI can always tell, 
Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt 
you. I see you ßinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when 
you touch me....Ó
ÒNo! My devotion to Your LordshipÑÓ
ÒYour devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not 
be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive with-
out you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk 
Nagini?Ó
ÒBut you seem so much stronger, my LordÑÓ
ÒLiar,Ó breathed the second voice. ÒI am no stronger, and a few 
days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have 
regained under your clumsy care. 
Silence!
ÓWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at 

once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the Þre 
crackling. 
!
en the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that 
was almost a hiss.
ÒI have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained 
to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few 
more months will make no di
"
erence. As for the protection sur-
rounding the boy, I believe my plan will be e
"
ective. All that is 
needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail
 Ñcourage you will 
Þnd, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Vol
 de mortÕs 
wrathÑÓ
ÒMy Lord, I must speak!Ó said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. 
ÒAll through our journey I have gone over the plan in my headÑ
my Lord, Bertha JorkinsÕs disappearance will not go unnoticed for 
long, and if we proceed, if I murderÑÓ
ÒIf?Ó whispered the second voice. Ò
If? 
If you follow the plan, 
Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. 
You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do 
it myself, but in my present condition
 ... Come, Wormtail, one 
more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not 
 asking 
you to do it alone. By that time, my 
faithful
 servant will have re-
joined usÑÓ
ÒI am a faithful servant,Ó said Wormtail, the merest trace of sul-
lenness in his voice.
ÒWormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose 
loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulÞll neither 
requirement.Ó
ÒI found you,Ó said Wormtail, and there was deÞnitely a sulky 
edge to his voice now. ÒI was the one who found you. I brought 
you Bertha Jorkins.Ó

Ò
!
at is true,Ó said the second man, sounding amused. ÒA stroke 
of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Worm-
tail
 Ñthough, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she 
would be when you caught her, were you?Ó
ÒI ÑI thought she might be useful, my LordÑÓ
ÒLiar,Ó said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more 
pronounced than ever. ÒHowever, I do not deny that her informa-
tion was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our 
plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will al-
low you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my 
followers would give their right hands to perform....Ó
ÒR-really, my Lord? What
 Ñ?Ó Wormtail sounded terriÞed 
again.
ÒAh, Wormtail, you donÕt want me to spoil the surprise? Your 
part will come at the very end
 ... but I promise you, you will have 
the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.Ó
ÒYou
 ... you...Ó WormtailÕs voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as 
though his mouth had gone very dry. ÒYou
 ... are going
 ... to kill 
me too?Ó
ÒWormtail, Wormtail,Ó said the cold voice silkily, Òwhy would I 
kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was Þt for nothing af-
ter my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions 
would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with 
the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are 
supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of 
Magic witches at wayside inns....Ó
Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not 
hear it, but it made the second man laugh
 Ñan entirely mirthless 
laugh, cold as his speech.

ÒWe could have modiÞed her memory?
 But Memory Charms can 
be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. 
It would be an insult to her 
memory
 not to use the information I 
extracted from her, Wormtail.Ó
Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand 
gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. 
!
e man with 
the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without 
any kind of remorse
 Ñwith 
amusement.
 He was dangerous
 Ña 
madman. And he was planning more murders
 Ñthis boy, Harry 
Potter, whoever he was
 Ñwas in danger
 ÑFrank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to 
the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for 
the telephone box in the village
 ... but the cold voice was speaking 
again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listen-
ing with all his might.
ÒOne more murder
 ... my faithful servant at Hogwarts
 ... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. 
!
ere will 
be no more argument. But quiet
 ... I think I hear Nagini....Ó
And the second manÕs voice changed. He started making noises 
such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting 
without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some 
sort of Þt or seizure.
And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark pas-
sageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with 
fright.
Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor 
ßoor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of Þrelight, he realized with 
a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet 
long. HorriÞed, transÞxed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut 

a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the ßoor, coming 
closer and closer
 ÑWhat was he to do? 
!
e only means of escape 
was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he 
stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him
 ÑBut before he had made his decision, the snake was level with 
him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was fol-
lowing the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond 
the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had 
vanished through the gap.
!
ere was sweat on FrankÕs forehead now, and the hand on the 
walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was 
continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an im-
possible idea.
 ... !
is man could talk to snakes.
Frank didnÕt understand what was going on. He wanted more 
than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. 
!
e problem was that his legs didnÕt seem to want to move. As he stood 
there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched 
abruptly to English again.
ÒNagini has interesting news, Wormtail,Ó it said.
ÒIn-indeed, my Lord?Ó said Wormtail.
ÒIndeed, yes,Ó said the voice. ÒAccording to Nagini, there is an 
old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every 
word we say.Ó
Frank didnÕt have a chance to hide himself. 
!
ere were footsteps, 
and then the door of the room was ßung wide open.
A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and 
small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm 
in his face.
ÒInvite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?Ó

!
e cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the 
Þre, but Frank couldnÕt see the speaker. 
!
e snake, on the other 
hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible 
travesty of a pet dog.
Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. 
!
ough still deeply 
shaken, Frank took a Þrmer grip upon his walking stick and limped 
over the threshold.
!
e Þre was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, 
 spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the 
armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his ser-
vant, for Frank couldnÕt even see the back of his head.
ÒYou heard everything, Muggle?Ó said the cold voice.
ÒWhatÕs that youÕre calling me?Ó said Frank deÞantly, for now 
that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some 
sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.
ÒI am calling you a Muggle,Ó said the voice coolly. ÒIt means that 
you are not a wizard.Ó
ÒI donÕt know what you mean by wizard,Ó said Frank, his voice 
growing steadier. ÒAll I know is IÕve heard enough to interest the 
police tonight, I have. YouÕve done murder and youÕre planning 
more! And IÕll tell you this too,Ó he added, on a sudden inspiration, 
Òmy wife knows IÕm up here, and if I donÕt come backÑÓ
ÒYou have no wife,Ó said the cold voice, very quietly. ÒNobody 
knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do 
not lie to Lord Vol
 de mort, Muggle, for he knows
 ... he always 
knows....Ó
ÒIs that right?Ó said Frank roughly. ÒLord, is it? Well, I donÕt 
think much of your manners, 
my Lord.
 Turn Õround and face me 
like a man, why donÕt you?Ó

ÒBut I am not a man, Muggle,Ó said the cold voice, barely audi-
ble now over the crackling of the ßames. ÒI am much, much more 
than a man. However
 ... why not? I will face you.
 ... Wormtail, 
come turn my chair around.Ó
!
e servant gave a whimper.
ÒYou heard me, Wormtail.Ó
Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have 
done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where 
the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the 
chair. 
!
e snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly 
as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.
And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sit-
ting in it. His walking stick fell to the ßoor with a clatter. He 
opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so 
loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as 
it raised a wand. 
!
ere was a ßash of green light, a rushing sound, 
and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the ßoor.
Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with 
a start.

 arry lay ßat on his back, breathing hard as though he had 
been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with 
his hands pressed over his face. 
!
e old scar on his forehead, which 
was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his Þngers 
as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in 
the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He 
put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, 
misty orange light that was Þltering through the curtains from the 
street lamp outside the window.
Harry ran his Þngers over the scar again. It was still painful. He 
turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the 
room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the in-
side of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his 
bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He 
 examined 


the lightning-bolt scar of his reßection more closely. It looked 
 normal, but it was still stinging.
Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he 
had awoken. It had seemed so real.
 ... !
ere had been two people 
he knew and one he didnÕt.
 ... He concentrated hard, frowning, 
trying to remember.
 ... !
e dim picture of a darkened room came to him.
 ... !
ere 
had been a snake on a hearth rug
 ... a small man called Peter, 
nicknamed Wormtail
 ... and a cold, high voice
 ... the voice of 
Lord Vol
 de mort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped 
down into his stomach at the very thought.
 ... He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Vol
 de-mort had looked like, but it was impossible.
 ... All Harry knew 
was that at the moment when Vol
 de mortÕs chair had swung 
around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt 
a spasm of horror, which had awoken him
 ... or had that been the 
pain in his scar?
And who had the old man been? For there had deÞnitely been an 
old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all be-
coming confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out 
his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit 
room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the 
details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to 
them....
 Vol
 de mort and Wormtail had been talking about some-
one they had killed, though Harry could not remember the 
name...
 and they had been plotting to kill someone else
 ...him
!Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared 
around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual 

there. As it happened, there were an extraordinary number of un-
usual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the 
foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and 
assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his 
desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his 
snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the ßoor beside his bed a 
book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last 
night. 
!
e pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright 
orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, 
throwing a red ball to one another.
Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one 
of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through 
a Þfty-foot-high hoop. 
!
en he snapped the book shut. Even 
 Quidditch
 Ñin HarryÕs opinion, the best sport in the worldÑ
couldnÕt distract him at the moment. He placed 
Flying with the 
Cannons 
on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew 
back the curtains to survey the street below.
Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street 
would be expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning. 
All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the 
darkness, there wasnÕt a living creature in sight, not even a cat.
And yet
 ... and yet
 ... Harry went restlessly back to the bed 
and sat down on it, running a Þnger over his scar again. It wasnÕt 
the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and in-
jury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had 
them painfully regrown in a night. 
!
e same arm had been pierced 
by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year 
Harry had fallen Þfty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was 
used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you 

attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a 
knack for attracting a lot of trouble.
No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time 
his scar had hurt him, it had been because Vol
 de mort had been 
close by.
 ... But Vol
 de mort couldnÕt be here, now.
 ... !
e idea of 
Vol
 de mort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible.
 ... Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half-
expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And 
then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tre-
mendous grunting snore from the next room.
Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. 
!
ere was 
no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, 
and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams un-
troubled and painless.
Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasnÕt as 
though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt 
Petunia, and Dudley were HarryÕs only living relatives. 
!
ey were 
Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant 
that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. 
!
ey 
had explained away HarryÕs long absences at Hogwarts over the last 
three years by telling everyone that he went to St. BrutusÕs Secure 
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. 
!
ey knew perfectly well 
that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasnÕt allowed to use magic out-
side Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything 
that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to 
conÞde in them or tell them anything about his life in the Wizard-
ing world. 
!
e very idea of going to them when they awoke, and 
telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries 
about Vol
 de mort, was laughable.

And yet it was because of Vol
 de mort that Harry had come to live 
with the Dursleys in the Þrst place. If it hadnÕt been for Vol
 de mort, 
Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it 
hadnÕt been for Vol
 de mort, Harry would still have had parents....
 Harry had been a year old the night that Vol
 de mort
 Ñthe most 
powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gain-
ing power steadily for eleven years
 Ñarrived at his house and 
killed his father and mother. Vol
 de mort had then turned his wand 
on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many 
full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power
 Ñand, 
incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the 
curse had rebounded upon Vol
 de mort. Harry had survived with 
nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Vol
 de-mort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, 
his life almost extinguished, Vol
 de mort had ßed; the terror in 
which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for 
so long had lifted, Vol
 de mortÕs followers had disbanded, and Harry 
Potter had become famous.
It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his elev-
enth birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more discon-
certing to Þnd out that everyone in the hidden Wizarding world 
knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to Þnd that heads 
turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was 
used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his 
fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days 
until he would be back at the castle again.
But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to 
school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye 

paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at 
the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and 
told them about his scar hurting?
At once, Her
 mi one GrangerÕs voice seemed to Þll his head, shrill 
and panicky.
ÒYour scar hurt? Harry, thatÕs really serious.
 ... Write to Professor 
Dum
 ble
 dore! And IÕll go and check 
Common Magical Ailments and Af
-ßictions.
 ... Maybe thereÕs something in there about curse scars....
ÓYes, that would be Her
 mi oneÕs advice: Go straight to the head-
master of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry 
stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted 
very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, 
he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Volde
-mortÕs; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would Þnd his 
symptoms listed in 
Common Magical Ailments and A
"
ictions.
 As 
for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dum
 ble
-dore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a 
moment, picturing Dum
 ble
 dore, with his long silver beard, full-
length wizardÕs robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach 
somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. 
Wherever Dum
 ble
 dore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig 
would be able to Þnd him; HarryÕs owl had never yet failed to de-
liver a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would 
he write?
Dear Professor Dum
 ble
 dore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt 
this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.
Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron WeasleyÕs, 

reaction, and in a moment, RonÕs red hair and long-nosed, freckled 
face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.
ÒYour scar hurt? But
 ... but You-Know-Who canÕt be near you 
now, can he? I mean
 ... youÕd know, wouldnÕt you? HeÕd be trying to 
do you in again, wouldnÕt he? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars 
 always 
twinge a bit.
 ... IÕll ask Dad....Ó
 Mr. Weasley was a fully qualiÞed wizard who worked in the 
Misuse of Muggle Artifacts O
$
ce at the Ministry of Magic, but he 
didnÕt have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far 
as Harry knew. In any case, Harry didnÕt like the idea of the whole 
Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about 
a few momentsÕ pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Her
 mi-one, and Fred and George, RonÕs sixteen-year-old twin brothers, 
might think Harry was losing his nerve. 
!
e Weasleys were HarryÕs 
favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite 
him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about 
the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didnÕt want his visit 
punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really 
wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was 
someone like
 Ñsomeone like a 
parent
: an adult wizard whose ad-
vice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about 
him, who had had experience with Dark Magic.
 ... And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so ob-
vious, that he couldnÕt believe it had taken so longÑ
 Sirius.
Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat 
down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, 
loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote 
Dear Sirius,
 then 
paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling 

at the fact that he hadnÕt thought of Sirius straight away. But then, 
perhaps it wasnÕt so surprising
 Ñafter all, he had only found out 
that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.
!
ere was a simple reason for SiriusÕs complete absence from 
HarryÕs life until then
 ÑSirius had been in Azkaban, the 
 terrifying 
wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-
sucking Þends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts 
when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent
 Ñthe murders 
for which he had been convicted had been committed by Worm-
tail, Vol
 de mortÕs supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed 
dead. Harry, Ron, and Her
 mi one knew otherwise, however; they 
had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, 
though only Professor Dum
 ble
 dore had believed their story.
For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving 
the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had o
"
ered him a home once 
his name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away 
from him
 ÑWormtail had escaped before they could take him to 
the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to ßee for his life. Harry 
had helped him escape on the back of a hippogri
" called 
 Buckbeak, 
and since then, Sirius had been on the run. 
!
e home Harry might 
have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all 
summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys know-
ing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.
Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he 
couldnÕt be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all 
his school things in his bedroom with him. 
!
e Dursleys had never 
allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miser-
able as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them 
to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every 

summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they 
had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a god-
father
 Ñfor Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that 
Sirius was innocent.
Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been 
back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was 
usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. 
Hedwig had not approved of these ßashy intruders; she had been 
most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before 
ßying o
" again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they 
put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, 
wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were inter-
cepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to 
imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight; perhaps 
that was why Sirius had gone south. SiriusÕs letters, which were 
now hidden beneath the highly useful loose ßoorboard under Har-
ryÕs bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded 
Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to 
now, all right.
 ... HarryÕs lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that 
precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun 
had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when 
sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt 
PetuniaÕs room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parch-
ment and reread his Þnished letter.
Dear Sirius,
!
anks for your last letter. 
!
at bird was enormous; it 
could hardly get through my window.

!
ings are the same as usual here. DudleyÕs diet isnÕt going 
too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his 
room yesterday. 
!
ey told him theyÕd have to cut his pocket 
money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked 
his PlayStation out of the window. 
!
atÕs a sort of computer 
thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasnÕt 
even got 
Mega-Mutilation Part 
!
ree 
to take his mind o
# things.
IÕm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terriÞed you 
might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.
A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar 
hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Vol
 de mort 
was at Hogwarts. But I donÕt reckon he can be anywhere near 
me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt 
years afterward?
IÕll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; sheÕs o
# hunt-
ing at the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me.
 Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. 
!
ere was no point put-
ting in the dream; he didnÕt want it to look as though he was too 
worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, 
ready for when Hedwig returned. 
!
en he got to his feet, stretched, 
and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his re-
ßection, he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.

y the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys 
were already seated around the table. None of them looked up 
as he entered or sat down. Uncle VernonÕs large red face was hidden 
behind the morningÕs 
Daily Mail,
 and Aunt Petunia was cutting a 
grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.
Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be 
taking up even more space than usual. 
!
is was saying something, 
as he always took up an entire side of the square table by 
 himself. 
When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto 
DudleyÕs plate with a tremulous Ò
!
ere you are, Diddy darling,Ó 
Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant 
turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year 
report.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to Þnd excuses 
for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dud-
ley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didnÕt understand him, 


while Uncle Vernon maintained that Òhe didnÕt want some swotty 
little nancy boy for a son anyway.Ó 
!
ey also skated over the accu-
sations of bullying in the reportÑÒHeÕs a boisterous little boy, but 
he wouldnÕt hurt a ßy!Ó Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.
However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-
 chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Ver-
non and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much 
Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his 
poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who 
needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outÞtters 
didnÕt stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. 
!
e school nurse had seen what Aunt PetuniaÕs eyesÑso sharp when 
it came to spotting Þngerprints on her gleaming walls, and in ob
-serving the comings and goings of the neighborsÑsimply refused 
to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had 
reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.
SoÑafter many tantrums, after arguments that shook 
 HarryÕs 
bedroom ßoor, and many tears from Aunt PetuniaÑthe new 
 regime had begun. 
!
e diet sheet that had been sent by the Smelt-
ings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been 
emptied of all DudleyÕs favorite thingsÑÞzzy drinks and cakes, 
chocolate bars and burgersÑand Þlled instead with fruit and veg-
etables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called Òrabbit 
food.Ó To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had 
insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed 
a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller 
than DudleyÕs. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to 
keep up DudleyÕs morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get 
more to eat than Harry.

But Aunt Petunia didnÕt know what was hidden under the loose 
ßoorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following 
the diet at all. 
!
e moment he had got wind of the fact that he was 
expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent 
Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to 
the occasion magniÞcently. Hedwig had returned from Her
 mi oneÕs 
house with a large box stu
"
ed full of sugar-free snacks. (Her
 mi-oneÕs parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had 
obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry 
hadnÕt touched these; he had had too much experience of HagridÕs 
cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, 
with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who 
was elderly and feeble, had needed a full Þve days to recover from 
the journey. And then on HarryÕs birthday (which the Dursleys had 
completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one 
each from Ron, Her
 mi one, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had two 
of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got 
back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.
Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sni
" of disap-
proval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.
ÒIs this it?Ó he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly 
at Dudley, who had already Þnished his own grapefruit quarter and 
was eyeing HarryÕs with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.
Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ru
#
ed his large, bushy 
mustache, and picked up his spoon.
!
e doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair 
and set o
" down the hall. Quick as a ßash, while his mother was 

occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle VernonÕs 
grapefruit.
Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and 
Uncle Vernon answering curtly. 
!
en the front door closed, and 
the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curi
-ously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didnÕt have 
to wait long to Þnd out; after about a minute, he was back. He 
looked livid.
ÒYou,Ó he barked at Harry. ÒIn the living room. Now.Ó
Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have 
done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of 
the kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door 
sharply behind both of them.
ÒSo,Ó he said, marching over to the Þreplace and turning to face 
Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. 
ÒSo.Ó
Harry would have dearly loved to have said, ÒSo what?Ó but he 
didnÕt feel that Uncle VernonÕs temper should be tested this early in 
the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from 
lack of food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.
Ò
!
is just arrived,Ó said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of 
purple writing paper at Harry. ÒA letter. About you.Ó
HarryÕs confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle 
Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the 
postman?
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter 
and began to read aloud:

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,
We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have 
heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.
As Harry might have told you, the Þnal of the Quidditch 
World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, 
Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his con-
nections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as 
this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasnÕt 
hosted the Cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard 
to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for 
the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely 
onto the train back to school.
It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly 
as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has 
never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows 
where it is.
Hoping to see Harry soon,
Yours sincerely,
P.S. I do hope weÕve put enough stamps on.
Uncle Vernon Þnished reading, put his hand back into his breast 
pocket, and drew out something else.
ÒLook at this,Ó he growled.
He held up the envelope in which Mrs. WeasleyÕs letter had 
come, and Harry had to Þght down a laugh. Every bit of it was 
 covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into 

which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the DursleysÕ address in minute 
writing.
ÒShe did put enough stamps on, then,Ó said Harry, trying to 
sound as though Mrs. WeasleyÕs was a mistake anyone could make. 
His uncleÕs eyes ßashed.
Ò
!
e postman noticed,Ó he said through gritted teeth. ÒVery in-
terested to know where this letter came from, he was. 
!
atÕs why he 
rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was 
funny.
ÓHarry didnÕt say anything. Other people might not understand 
why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, 
but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how 
touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary. 
!
eir worst fear was that someone would Þnd out that they were 
connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.
Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his 
expression neutral. If he didnÕt do or say anything stupid, he might 
just be in for the treat of a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to 
say something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry decided to 
break the silence.
ÒSoÑcan I go then?Ó he asked.
A slight spasm crossed Uncle VernonÕs large purple face. 
!
e mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on be-
hind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle VernonÕs most 
fundamental instincts came into conßict. Allowing Harry to go 
would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled 
against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to 
disappear to the WeasleysÕ for the rest of the summer would get 
rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and 
Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself 

thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. WeasleyÕs letter 
again.
ÒWho is this woman?Ó he said, staring at the signature with 
distaste.
ÒYouÕve seen her,Ó said Harry. ÒSheÕs my friend RonÕs mother, she 
was meeting him o
" the HogÑo
" the school train at the end of 
last term.Ó
He had almost said ÒHogwarts Express,Ó and that was a sure way 
to get his uncleÕs temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of 
HarryÕs school aloud in the Dursley household.
Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to 
remember something very unpleasant.
ÒDumpy sort of woman?Ó he growled Þnally. ÒLoad of children 
with red hair?Ó
Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon 
to call anyone Òdumpy,Ó when his own son, Dudley, had Þnally 
achieved what heÕd been threatening to do since the age of three, 
and become wider than he was tall.
Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.
ÒQuidditch,Ó he muttered under his breath. Ò
QuidditchÑ
what 
is this rubbish?Ó
Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
ÒItÕs a sport,Ó he said shortly. ÒPlayed on broomÑÓ
ÒAll right, all right!Ó said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with 
some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Appar-
ently his nerves couldnÕt stand the sound of the word Òbroom-
sticksÓ in his living room. He took refuge in perusing the letter 
again. Harry saw his lips form the words Òsend us your answer
 ... in the normal way.Ó He scowled.

ÒWhat does she mean, Ôthe normal wayÕ?Ó he spat.
ÒNormal for us,Ó said Harry, and before his uncle could stop 
him, he added, Òyou know, owl post. 
!
atÕs whatÕs normal for 
wizards.Ó
Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a 
disgusting swearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look 
through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neigh-
bors with their ears pressed against the glass.
ÒHow many times do I have to tell you not to mention that un-
naturalness under my roof?Ó he hissed, his face now a rich plum 
color. ÒYou stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on 
your ungrateful backÑÓ
ÒOnly after Dudley Þnished with them,Ó said Harry coldly, and 
indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had 
had to roll back the sleeves Þve times so as to be able to use his 
hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.
ÒI will not be spoken to like that!Ó said Uncle Vernon, trembling 
with rage.
But Harry wasnÕt going to stand for this. Gone were the days 
when he had been forced to take every single one of the DursleysÕ 
stupid rules. He wasnÕt following DudleyÕs diet, and he wasnÕt 
 going 
to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World 
Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying breath 
and then said, ÒOkay, I canÕt see the World Cup. Can I go now, 
then? Only IÕve got a letter to Sirius I want to Þnish. You knowÑ
my godfather.Ó
He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched 
the purple recede blotchily from Uncle VernonÕs face, making it 
look like badly mixed black currant ice cream.

ÒYouÕreÑyouÕre writing to him, are you?Ó said Uncle Vernon, 
in a would-be calm voiceÑbut Harry had seen the pupils of his 
tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.
ÒWellÑyeah,Ó said Harry, casually. ÒItÕs been a while since he 
heard from me, and, you know, if he doesnÕt, he might start think-
ing somethingÕs wrong.Ó
He stopped there to enjoy the e
"
ect of these words. He could al-
most see the cogs working under Uncle VernonÕs thick, dark, neatly 
parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would 
think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldnÕt go 
to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, 
who would 
know 
Harry was being mistreated. 
!
ere was only one 
thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion 
forming in his uncleÕs mind as though the great mustached face 
were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as 
blank as possible. And thenÑ
ÒWell, all right then. You can go to this ruddy
 ... this stupid...
 this World Cup thing. You write and tell theseÑthese 
Weasleys
 theyÕre to pick you up, mind. I havenÕt got time to go dropping you 
o
" all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer 
there. And you can tell yourÑyour godfather
 ... tell him
 ... tell 
him youÕre going.Ó
ÒOkay then,Ó said Harry brightly.
He turned and walked toward the living room door, Þghting 
the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going
 ... he was 
 going to the WeasleysÕ, he was going to watch the Quidditch World 
Cup!
Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been 
lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry 
 being 

told o
"
. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on HarryÕs  
face.
Ò
!
at was an 
excellent 
breakfast, wasnÕt it?Ó said Harry. ÒI feel 
really full, donÕt you?Ó
Laughing at the astonished look on DudleyÕs face, Harry 
took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his 
bedroom.
!
e Þrst thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was 
 sitting 
in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and 
clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about 
something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent al-
most at once.
ÒOUCH!Ó said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, 
 feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry mas-
saged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and 
saw a minute owl, small enough to Þt into the palm of his hand, 
whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose Þrework. Harry 
then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry 
bent down, recognized RonÕs handwriting, then tore open the en-
velope. Inside was a hastily scribbled note.
HarryÑDAD GOT THE TICKETSÑIreland versus 
Bulgaria, Monday night. MumÕs writing to the Muggles to 
ask you to stay. 
!
ey might already have the letter, I donÕt 
know how fast Muggle post is. 
!
ought IÕd send this with Pig 
anyway.
Harry stared at the word ÒPig,Ó then looked up at the tiny owl 
now zooming around the light Þxture on the ceiling. He had never 

seen anything that looked less like a pig. Maybe he couldnÕt read 
RonÕs writing. He went back to the letter:
WeÕre coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you 
canÕt miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon itÕs better 
if we pretend to ask their permission Þrst. If they say yes, send 
Pig back with your answer pronto, and weÕll come and get you 
at Þve oÕclock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto 
and weÕll come and get you at Þve oÕclock on Sunday anyway.
Her
 mi oneÕs arriving this afternoon. PercyÕs started workÑ
the Department of International Magical Cooperation. DonÕt 
mention anything about Abroad while youÕre here unless you 
want the pants bored o
# you.
See you soonÑ
ÒCalm down!Ó Harry said as the small owl ßew low over his 
head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was 
pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. ÒCome here, 
I need you to take my answer back!Ó
!
e owl ßuttered down on top of HedwigÕs cage. Hedwig looked 
coldly up at it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.
Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh 
piece of parchment, and wrote:
Ron, itÕs all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you Þve 
oÕclock tomorrow. CanÕt wait.

He folded this note up very small, and with immense di
$
culty, 
tied it to the tiny owlÕs leg as it hopped on the spot with excite-
ment. 
!
e moment the note was secure, the owl was o
" again; it 
zoomed out of the window and out of sight.
Harry turned to Hedwig.
ÒFeeling up to a long journey?Ó he asked her.
Hedwig hooted in a digniÞed sort of a way.
ÒCan you take this to Sirius for me?Ó he said, picking up his let-
ter. ÒHang on
 ... I just want to Þnish it.Ó
He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.
If you want to contact me, IÕll be at my friend Ron 
 WeasleyÕs 
for the rest of the summer. His dadÕs got us tickets for the 
 Quidditch World Cup!
!
e letter Þnished, he tied it to HedwigÕs leg; she kept unusually 
still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should 
behave.
ÒIÕll be at RonÕs when you get back, all right?Ó Harry told her.
She nipped his Þnger a
"
ectionately, then, with a soft swoosh-
ing noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open 
window.
Harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, 
wrenched up the loose ßoorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of 
birthday cake. He sat there on the ßoor eating it, savoring the hap-
piness that was ßooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley 
had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summerÕs day, he would 

be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal 
again, and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It 
was hard, just now, to feel worried about anythingÑeven Lord 
Vol
 de mort.

y twelve oÕclock the next day, HarryÕs school trunk was packed 
with his school things and all his most prized possessionsÑ 
the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broom-
stick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he 
had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emp-
tied his hiding place under the loose ßoorboard of all food, 
 double- 
checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten 
 spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall count-
ing down the days to September the Þrst, on which he liked to 
cross o
" the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.
!
e atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely 
tense. 
!
e imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wiz-
ards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon 
had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the 
Weasleys would be arriving at Þve oÕclock the very next day.
ÒI hope you told them to dress properly, these people,Ó he 


snarled at once. ÒIÕve seen the sort of stu
" your lot wear. 
!
eyÕd 
better have the decency to put on normal clothes, thatÕs all.Ó
Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or 
Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call Ònor-
mal.Ó 
!
eir children might don Muggle clothing during the holi-
days, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying 
states of shabbiness. Harry wasnÕt bothered about what the neigh-
bors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys 
might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst 
idea of wizards.
Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this 
might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it 
was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimi-
dating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. 
!
is was not because the diet was at last taking e
"
ect, but due to 
fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-
grown wizard with a curly pigÕs tail poking out of the seat of his 
trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its 
removal at a private hospital in London. It wasnÕt altogether sur-
prising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously 
over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as 
not to present the same target to the enemy.
Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didnÕt even protest at 
the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasnÕt 
eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, 
and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back 
the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.
Ò
!
eyÕll be driving, of course?Ó Uncle Vernon barked across the 
table.

ÒEr,Ó said Harry.
He hadnÕt thought of that. How 
were
 the Weasleys going to pick 
him up? 
!
ey didnÕt have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they 
had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden For-
est at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of 
Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?
ÒI think so,Ó said Harry.
Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Ver-
non would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to 
judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were. But 
Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. 
Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.
Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldnÕt 
stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains 
every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an 
escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to Þve, Harry went back 
downstairs and into the living room.
Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle 
Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were 
not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his 
might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed 
into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped Þrmly 
around his bottom. Harry couldnÕt take the tension; he left the 
room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his 
watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.
But Þve oÕclock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring 
slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the 
street, then withdrew his head quickly.
Ò
!
eyÕre late!Ó he snarled at Harry.

ÒI know,Ó said Harry. ÒMaybeÑerÑthe tra
$
cÕs bad, or 
something.Ó
Ten past Þve
 ... then a quarter past Þve
 ... Harry was starting 
to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon 
and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.
ÒNo consideration at all.Ó
ÒWe mightÕve had an engagement.Ó
ÒMaybe they think theyÕll get invited to dinner if theyÕre late.Ó
ÒWell, they most certainly wonÕt be,Ó said Uncle Vernon, and 
Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room. 
Ò
!
eyÕll take the boy and go, thereÕll be no hanging around. 
!
atÕs 
if theyÕre coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay 
their 
kind 
donÕt set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive 
some tin-pot car thatÕs broken dÑAAAAAAAARRRRRGH!Ó
Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door 
came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, 
across the room. Next moment Dudley came ßying into the hall, 
looking terriÞed.
ÒWhat happened?Ó said Harry. ÒWhatÕs the matter?Ó
But Dudley didnÕt seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over 
his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry 
hurried into the living room.
Loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the 
DursleysÕ boarded-up Þreplace, which had a fake coal Þre plugged 
in front of it.
ÒWhat is it?Ó gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall 
and was staring, terriÞed, toward the Þre. ÒWhat is it, Vernon?Ó
But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could 
be heard from inside the blocked Þreplace.

ÒOuch! Fred, noÑgo back, go back, thereÕs been some kind of 
mistakeÑtell George not toÑOUCH! George, no, thereÕs no 
room, go back quickly and tell RonÑÓ
ÒMaybe Harry can hear us, DadÑmaybe heÕll be able to let us 
outÑÓ
!
ere was a loud hammering of Þsts on the boards behind the 
electric Þre.
ÒHarry? Harry, can you hear us?Ó
!
e Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.
ÒWhat is this?Ó growled Uncle Vernon. ÒWhatÕs going on?Ó
Ò
!
eyÑtheyÕve tried to get here by Floo powder,Ó said Harry, 
Þghting a mad desire to laugh. Ò
!
ey can travel by ÞreÑonly 
youÕve blocked the ÞreplaceÑhang onÑÓ
He approached the Þreplace and called through the boards.
ÒMr. Weasley? Can you hear me?Ó
!
e hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece 
said, ÒShh!Ó
ÒMr. Weasley, itÕs Harry
 ... the Þreplace has been blocked up. 
You wonÕt be able to get through there.Ó
ÒDamn!Ó said Mr. WeasleyÕs voice. ÒWhat on earth did they 
want to block up the Þreplace for?Ó
Ò
!
eyÕve got an electric Þre,Ó Harry explained.
ÒReally?Ó said Mr. WeasleyÕs voice excitedly. ÒEclectic, you say? 
With a 
plug
? Gracious, I must see that.
 ... LetÕs think
 ... ouch, 
Ron!Ó
RonÕs voice now joined the othersÕ.
ÒWhat are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?Ó
ÒOh no, Ron,Ó came FredÕs voice, very sarcastically. ÒNo, this is 
exactly where we wanted to end up.Ó

ÒYeah, weÕre having the time of our lives here,Ó said George, 
whose voice sounded mu
#
ed, as though he was squashed against 
the wall.
ÒBoys, boys...Ó said Mr. Weasley vaguely. ÒIÕm trying to think 
what to do.
 ... Yes
 ... only way
 ... Stand back, Harry.Ó
Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved 
forward.
ÒWait a moment!Ó he bellowed at the Þre. ÒWhat exactly are you 
going toÑÓ
BANG.
!
e electric Þre shot across the room as the boarded-up Þreplace 
burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a 
cloud of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell 
backward over the co
"
ee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she 
hit the ßoor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom 
had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical 
to the last freckle.
Ò
!
atÕs better,Ó panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long 
green robes and straightening his glasses. ÒAhÑyou must be 
 HarryÕs aunt and uncle!Ó
Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his 
hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, 
dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His 
best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair 
and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty 
years.
ÒErÑyesÑsorry about that,Ó said Mr. Weasley, lowering his 
hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted Þreplace. ÒItÕs all 

my fault. It just didnÕt occur to me that we wouldnÕt be able to get 
out at the other end. I had your Þreplace connected to the Floo 
 Network, you seeÑjust for an afternoon, you know, so we could 
get Harry. Muggle Þreplaces arenÕt supposed to be connected, 
strictly speakingÑbut IÕve got a useful contact at the Floo Regu-
lation Panel and he Þxed it for me. I can put it right in a ji
"
y, 
though, donÕt worry. IÕll light a Þre to send the boys back, and then 
I can repair your Þreplace before I Disapparate.Ó
Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadnÕt understood a 
single word of this. 
!
ey were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thun-
derstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind 
Uncle Vernon.
ÒHello, Harry!Ó said Mr. Weasley brightly. ÒGot your trunk 
ready?Ó
ÒItÕs upstairs,Ó said Harry, grinning back.
ÒWeÕll get it,Ó said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and 
George left the room. 
!
ey knew where HarryÕs bedroom was, hav-
ing once rescued him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected 
that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they 
had heard a lot about him from Harry.
ÒWell,Ó said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he 
tried to Þnd words to break the very nasty silence. ÒVeryÑermÑ
very nice place youÕve got here.Ó
As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and 
bits of brick, this remark didnÕt go down too well with the Durs-
leys. Uncle VernonÕs face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia 
started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too 
scared to actually say anything.

Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do 
with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the 
television and the video recorder.
Ò
!
ey run o
" eckeltricity, do they?Ó he said knowledgeably. ÒAh 
yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,Ó he added to Uncle Vernon. 
ÒAnd batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife 
thinks IÕm mad, but there you are.Ó
Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He 
moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from 
view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at 
them and attack.
Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the 
clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had 
scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, 
gazing at Mr. Weasley with terriÞed eyes, and attempted to conceal 
himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Ver-
nonÕs bulk, while su
$
cient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was no-
where near enough to conceal Dudley.
ÒAh, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?Ó said Mr. Weasley, taking 
another brave stab at making conversation.
ÒYep,Ó said Harry, ÒthatÕs Dudley.Ó
He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away 
from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost 
overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though 
afraid it might fall o
"
. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely 
concerned at DudleyÕs peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone 
of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. 
 Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought 
he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.

ÒHaving a good holiday, Dudley?Ó he said kindly.
Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder 
over his massive backside.
Fred and George came back into the room carrying HarryÕs 
school trunk. 
!
ey glanced around as they entered and spotted 
Dudley. 
!
eir faces cracked into identical evil grins.
ÒAh, right,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒBetter get cracking then.Ó
He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. 
Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.
ÒIncendio!Ó 
said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in 
the wall behind him.
Flames rose at once in the Þreplace, crackling merrily as though 
they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small draw-
string bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder 
inside, and threw it onto the ßames, which turned emerald green 
and roared higher than ever.
ÒO
" you go then, Fred,Ó said Mr. Weasley.
ÒComing,Ó said Fred. ÒOh no
Ñhang onÑÓ
A bag of sweets had spilled out of FredÕs pocket and the contents 
were now rolling in every directionÑbig, fat to
"
ees in brightly 
colored wrappers.
Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, 
then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked 
right into the Þre, saying Òthe Burrow!Ó Aunt Petunia gave a 
 little shuddering gasp. 
!
ere was a whooshing sound, and Fred 
vanished.
ÒRight then, George,Ó said Mr. Weasley, Òyou and the trunk.Ó
Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the ßames 
and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. 
!
en, with 

a second whoosh, George had cried Òthe Burrow!Ó and vanished 
too.
ÒRon, you next,Ó said Mr. Weasley.
ÒSee you,Ó said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned 
broadly at Harry, then stepped into the Þre, shouted Òthe Burrow!Ó 
and disappeared.
Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.
ÒWell...Õbye then,Ó Harry said to the Dursleys.
!
ey didnÕt say anything at all. Harry moved toward the Þre, but 
just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out 
a hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in 
amazement.
ÒHarry said good-bye to you,Ó he said. ÒDidnÕt you hear him?Ó
ÒIt doesnÕt matter,Ó Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. ÒHonestly, I 
donÕt care.Ó
Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from HarryÕs shoulder.
ÒYou arenÕt going to see your nephew till next summer,Ó he said 
to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. ÒSurely youÕre going to say 
good-bye?Ó
Uncle VernonÕs face worked furiously. 
!
e idea of being taught 
consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his 
 living 
room wall seemed to be causing him intense su
"
ering. But Mr. Wea
-sleyÕs wand was still in his hand, and Uncle VernonÕs tiny eyes darted 
to it once, before he said, very resentfully, ÒGood-bye, then.Ó
ÒSee you,Ó said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green 
ßames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, 
however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt 
Petunia started to scream.
Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind 

his parents. He was kneeling beside the co
"
ee table, and he was 
gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was 
protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry 
realized that the foot-long thing was DudleyÕs tongueÑand that 
a brightly colored to
"
ee wrapper lay on the ßoor before him.
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, 
seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench 
it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered 
worse than ever, trying to Þght her o
"
. Uncle Vernon was bellow-
ing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to 
make himself heard.
ÒNot to worry, I can sort him out!Ó he yelled, advancing on 
Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed 
worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him 
from Mr. Weasley.
ÒNo, really!Ó said Mr. Weasley desperately. ÒItÕs a simple 
 processÑ 
it was the to
"
eeÑmy son FredÑreal practical jokerÑbut itÕs 
only an Engorgement CharmÑat least, I think it isÑplease, I can 
correct itÑÓ
But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-
stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging DudleyÕs 
tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to 
be su
"
ocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his 
tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized 
a china Þgure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard 
at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in 
the blasted Þreplace.
ÒNow really!Ó said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. 
ÒIÕm trying to 
help
!Ó
Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up an-
other ornament.
ÒHarry, go! Just go!Ó Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle 
Vernon. ÒIÕll sort this out!Ó
Harry didnÕt want to miss the fun, but Uncle VernonÕs second 
ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it 
best to leave the situation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the Þre, 
looking over his shoulder as he said Òthe Burrow!Ó His last ßeeting 
glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third or-
nament out of Uncle VernonÕs hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia 
screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and DudleyÕs tongue lolling 
around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had be-
gun to spin very fast, and the DursleysÕ living room was whipped 
out of sight in a rush of emerald-green ßames.

 arry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his 
sides, blurred Þreplaces ßashing past him, until he started 
to feel sick and closed his eyes. 
!
en, when at last he felt himself 
slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time 
to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the WeasleysÕ 
kitchen Þre.
ÒDid he eat it?Ó said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull 
Harry to his feet.
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry, straightening up. ÒWhat 
was 
it?Ó
ÒTon-Tongue To
"
ee,Ó said Fred brightly. ÒGeorge and I in-
vented them, and weÕve been looking for someone to test them on 
all summer....Ó
!
e tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around 
and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden 
table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, 



though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, 
the two eldest Weasley brothers.
ÒHowÕre you doing, Harry?Ó said the nearer of the two, grinning 
at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling 
calluses and blisters under his Þngers. 
!
is had to be Charlie, who 
worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, 
shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and 
lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-
beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were 
muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.
Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook HarryÕs hand. Bill 
came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for 
the Wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy 
at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version 
of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone 
around. However, Bill wasÑthere was no other word for itÑ
cool. 
He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. 
He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling 
from it. BillÕs clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock 
concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of 
leather, but of dragon hide.
Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint 
 popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at 
GeorgeÕs shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever 
seen him.
Ò
!
at 
wasnÕt funny,
 Fred!Ó he shouted. ÒWhat on earth did you 
give that Muggle boy?Ó
ÒI didnÕt give him anything,Ó said Fred, with another evil grin. ÒI 


just 
dropped 
it.
 ... It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told 
him to.Ó
ÒYou dropped it on purpose!Ó roared
 Mr. Weasley. ÒYou knew 
heÕd eat it, you knew he was on a dietÑÓ
ÒHow big did his tongue get?Ó George asked eagerly.
ÒIt was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!Ó
Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.
ÒIt 
isnÕt funny
!Ó Mr. Weasley shouted. Ò
!
at sort of behavior se-
riously undermines wizardÐMuggle relations! I spend half my life 
campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own 
sonsÑÓ
ÒWe didnÕt give it to him because heÕs a Muggle!Ó said Fred 
indignantly.
ÒNo, we gave it to him because heÕs a great bullying git,Ó said 
George. ÒIsnÕt he, Harry?Ó
ÒYeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,Ó said Harry earnestly.
Ò
!
atÕs not the point!Ó raged Mr. Weasley. ÒYou wait until I tell 
your motherÑÓ
ÒTell me what?Ó said a voice behind them.
Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, 
plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were pres-
ently narrowed with suspicion.
ÒOh hello, Harry, dear,Ó she said, spotting him and smil-
ing. 
!
en her eyes snapped back to her husband. ÒTell me 
what, 
Arthur?Ó
Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry 
he was with Fred and George, he hadnÕt really intended to tell 
Mrs. Weasley what had happened. 
!
ere was a silence, while Mr. 

 Weasley eyed his wife nervously. 
!
en two girls appeared in the 
kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy 
brown hair and rather large front teeth, was HarryÕs and RonÕs 
friend, Her
 mi one Granger. 
!
e other, who was small and red-
haired, was RonÕs younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at 
Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarletÑshe had 
been very taken with Harry ever since his Þrst visit to the Burrow.
ÒTell me 
what, 
Arthur?Ó Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous 
sort of voice.
ÒItÕs nothing, Molly,Ó mumbled Mr. Weasley, ÒFred and George 
justÑbut IÕve had words with themÑÓ
ÒWhat have they done this time?Ó said Mrs. Weasley. ÒIf itÕs got 
anything to do with WeasleysÕ Wizard WheezesÑÓ
ÒWhy donÕt you show Harry where heÕs sleeping, Ron?Ó said 
Her
 mi one from the doorway.
ÒHe knows where heÕs sleeping,Ó said Ron, Òin my room, he slept 
there lastÑÓ
ÒWe can all go,Ó said Her
 mi one pointedly.
ÒOh,Ó said Ron, cottoning on. ÒRight.Ó
ÒYeah, weÕll come too,Ó said George.
ÒYou stay where you are!Ó 
snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Her
 mi one, 
and Ginny set o
" along the narrow hallway and up the rickety 
staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.
ÒWhat
 are WeasleysÕ Wizard Wheezes?Ó Harry asked as they 
climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Her
 mi one didnÕt.
ÒMum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning 


Fred and GeorgeÕs room,Ó said Ron quietly. ÒGreat long price lists 
for stu
" theyÕve invented. Joke stu
"
, you know. Fake wands and 
trick sweets, loads of stu
"
. It was brilliant, I never knew theyÕd been 
inventing all that...Ó
ÒWeÕve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but 
we never thought they were actually 
making
 things,Ó said Ginny. 
ÒWe thought they just liked the noise.Ó
ÒOnly, most of the stu
"
Ñwell, all of it, reallyÑwas a bit dan-
gerous,Ó said Ron, Òand, you know, they were planning to sell it at 
Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told 
them they werenÕt allowed to make any more of it, and burned all 
the order forms.
 ... SheÕs furious at them anyway. 
!
ey didnÕt get 
as many O.W.L.s as she expected.Ó
O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations 
Hogwarts students took at the age of Þfteen.
ÒAnd then there was this big row,Ó Ginny said, Òbecause Mum 
wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they 
told her all they want to do is open a joke shop.Ó
Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked 
out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.
ÒHi, Percy,Ó said Harry.
ÒOh hello, Harry,Ó said Percy. ÒI was wondering who was mak-
ing all the noise. IÕm trying to work in here, you knowÑIÕve got 
a report to Þnish for the o
$
ceÑand itÕs rather di
$
cult to con
-centrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.Ó
ÒWeÕre not 
thundering,Ó 
said Ron irritably. ÒWeÕre walking. Sorry if 
weÕve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.Ó
ÒWhat are you working on?Ó said Harry.

ÒA report for the Department of International Magical Cooper
-ation,Ó said Percy smugly. ÒWeÕre trying to standardize cauldron 
thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too 
thinÑleakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three per-
cent a yearÑÓ
Ò
!
atÕll change the world, that report will,Ó said Ron. ÒFront 
page of the 
Daily Prophet,
 I expect, cauldron leaks.Ó
Percy went slightly pink.
ÒYou might sneer, Ron,Ó he said heatedly, Òbut unless some 
sort of international law is imposed we might well Þnd the mar-
ket ßooded with ßimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously 
endangerÑÓ
ÒYeah, yeah, all right,Ó said Ron, and he started o
" upstairs 
again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Her
 mi-one, and Ginny followed Ron up three more ßights of stairs, shouts 
from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though 
Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the to
"
ees.
!
e room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much 
as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same post-
ers of RonÕs favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were 
whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the Þsh 
tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, 
now contained one extremely large frog. RonÕs old rat, Scabbers, 
was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had 
delivered RonÕs letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up 
and down in a small cage and twittering madly.
ÒShut 
up, 
Pig,Ó said Ron, edging his way between two of the 
four beds that had been squeezed into the room. ÒFred and George 
are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,Ó he 


told Harry. ÒPercy gets to keep his room all to himself because heÕs 
got to 
work.
ÓÒErÑwhy are you calling that owl Pig?Ó Harry asked Ron.
ÒBecause heÕs being stupid,Ó said Ginny. ÒIts proper name is 
Pigwidgeon.Ó
ÒYeah, and thatÕs not a stupid name at all,Ó said Ron sarcasti-
cally. ÒGinny named him,Ó he explained to Harry. ÒShe reckons itÕs 
sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he wonÕt answer 
to anything else. So now heÕs Pig. IÕve got to keep him up here be-
cause he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to 
that.Ó
Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. 
Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned 
continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset 
when Her
 mi oneÕs cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.
ÒWhereÕs Crookshanks?Ó Harry asked Her
 mi one now.
ÒOut in the garden, I expect,Ó she said. ÒHe likes chasing gnomes. 
HeÕs never seen any before.Ó
ÒPercyÕs enjoying work, then?Ó said Harry, sitting down on one 
of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and 
out of the posters on the ceiling.
ÒEnjoying it?Ó said Ron darkly. ÒI donÕt reckon heÕd come home 
if Dad didnÕt make him. HeÕs obsessed. Just donÕt get him onto the 
subject of his boss. 
According to Mr. Crouch
 ... as I was saying to Mr. 
Crouch
 ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion
 ... Mr. Crouch was telling 
me ... !
eyÕll be announcing their engagement any day now.Ó
ÒHave you had a good summer, Harry?Ó said Her
 mi one. ÒDid 
you get our food parcels and everything?Ó
ÒYeah, thanks a lot,Ó said Harry. Ò
!
ey saved my life, those cakes.Ó

ÒAnd have you heard fromÑ?Ó Ron began, but at a look from 
Her
 mi one he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask 
about Sirius. Ron and Her
 mi one had been so deeply involved in 
helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were 
almost as concerned about HarryÕs godfather as he was. However, 
discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but 
themselves and Professor Dum
 ble
 dore knew about how Sirius had 
escaped, or believed in his innocence.
ÒI think theyÕve stopped arguing,Ó said Her
 mi one, to cover the 
awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron 
to Harry. ÒShall we go down and help your mum with dinner?Ó
ÒYeah, all right,Ó said Ron. 
!
e four of them left RonÕs room and 
went back downstairs to Þnd Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, 
looking extremely bad-tempered.
ÒWeÕre eating out in the garden,Ó she said when they came in. 
Ò
!
ereÕs just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take 
the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. 
Knives and forks, please, you two,Ó she said to Ron and Harry, 
pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended 
at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast 
that they ricocheted o
" the walls and ceiling.
ÒOh for heavenÕs 
sake,Ó
 she snapped, now directing her wand at 
a dustpan, which hopped o
" the sideboard and started skating 
across the ßoor, scooping up the potatoes. Ò
!
ose two!Ó she burst 
out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and 
Harry knew she meant Fred and George. ÒI donÕt know whatÕs go-
ing to happen to them, I really donÕt. No ambition, unless you 
count making as much trouble as they possibly can....Ó
Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the 


kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A 
creamy sauce poured from the wand-tip as she stirred.
ÒItÕs not as though they havenÕt got brains,Ó she continued irrita-
bly, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a fur-
ther poke of her wand, Òbut theyÕre wasting them, and unless they 
pull themselves together soon, theyÕll be in real trouble. IÕve had 
more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If 
they carry on the way theyÕre going, theyÕll end up in front of the 
Improper Use of Magic O
$
ce.Ó
Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot 
open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives 
soared out of it, ßew across the kitchen, and began chopping the 
potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the 
dustpan.
ÒI donÕt know where we went wrong with them,Ó said Mrs. 
 Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more 
saucepans. ÒItÕs been the same for years, one thing after another, 
and they wonÕt listen toÑOH NOT 
AGAIN!
ÓShe had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted 
a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.
ÒOne of their fake wands again!Ó she shouted. ÒHow many times 
have I told them not to leave them lying around?Ó
She grabbed her real wand and turned around to Þnd that the 
sauce on the stove was smoking.
ÒCÕmon,Ó Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cut-
lery from the open drawer, ÒletÕs go and help Bill and Charlie.Ó
!
ey left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into 
the yard.
!
ey had only gone a few paces when Her
 mi oneÕs bandy-legged 

ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-
brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy 
potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten 
inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted 
across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington 
boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the 
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the 
boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was 
coming from the other side of the house. 
!
e source of the com
-motion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill 
and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two bat-
tered old tables ßy high above the lawn, smashing into each other, 
each attempting to knock the otherÕs out of the air. Fred and 
George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Her
 mi one was 
hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and 
anxiety.
BillÕs table caught CharlieÕs with a huge bang and knocked 
one of its legs o
"
. 
!
ere was a clatter from overhead, and they all 
looked up to see PercyÕs head poking out of a window on the sec-
ond ßoor.
ÒWill you keep it down?!Ó he bellowed.
ÒSorry, Perce,Ó said Bill, grinning. ÒHowÕre the cauldron bot-
toms coming on?Ó
ÒVery badly,Ó said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window 
shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the 
grass, end to end, and then, with a ßick of his wand, Bill reattached 
the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.
By seven oÕclock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and 
dishes of Mrs. WeasleyÕs excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, 


Harry, and Her
 mi one were settling themselves down to eat 
 beneath 
a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals 
of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at Þrst, 
Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken 
and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about 
his report on cauldron bottoms.
ÒIÕve told Mr. Crouch that IÕll have it ready by Tuesday,Ó Percy 
was saying pompously. Ò
!
atÕs a bit sooner than he expected it, but 
I like to keep on top of things. I think heÕll be grateful IÕve done 
it in good time, I mean, itÕs extremely busy in our department just 
now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. WeÕre just 
not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical 
Games and Sports. Ludo BagmanÑÓ
ÒI like Ludo,Ó said Mr. Weasley mildly. ÒHe was the one who 
got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His 
brother, Otto, got into a spot of troubleÑa lawnmower with un-
natural powersÑI smoothed the whole thing over.Ó
ÒOh BagmanÕs 
likable 
enough, of course,
Ó said Percy dismis-
sively, Òbut how he ever got to be Head of Department
 ... when I 
 compare him to Mr. Crouch! I canÕt see Mr. Crouch losing a mem-
ber of our department and not trying to Þnd out whatÕs happened 
to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a 
month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?Ó
ÒYes, I was asking Ludo about that,Ó said Mr. Weasley, 
 frowning. 
ÒHe says BerthaÕs gotten lost plenty of times before nowÑthough I 
must say, if it was someone in my department, IÕd be worried....Ó
ÒOh BerthaÕs 
hopeless,
 all right,Ó said Percy. ÒI hear sheÕs been 
shunted from department to department for years, much more 

trouble than sheÕs worth
 ... but all the same, Bagman ought to be 
trying to Þnd her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, 
she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think 
Mr. Crouch was quite fond of herÑbut Bagman just keeps laugh-
ing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Aus-
tralia instead of Albania. HoweverÓÑPercy heaved an impressive 
sigh and took a deep swig of elderßower wineÑÒweÕve got quite 
enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical 
Cooperation without trying to Þnd members of other departments 
too. As you know, weÕve got another big event to organize right 
after the World Cup.Ó
Percy cleared his throat signiÞcantly and looked down toward 
the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and Her
 mi one were sitting. 
ÒYou 
know the one IÕm talking about, Father.Ó He raised his voice 
slightly. Ò
!
e top-secret one.Ó
Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Her
 mi one, ÒHeÕs 
been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started 
work. Probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.Ó
In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill 
about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.
Ò...with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they 
say at the bank?Ó
ÒMum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I 
bring home plenty of treasure,Ó said Bill patiently.
ÒAnd your hairÕs getting silly, dear,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, Þngering 
her wand lovingly. ÒI wish youÕd let me give it a trim....Ó
ÒI like it,Ó said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. ÒYouÕre so old-
fashioned, Mum. Anyway, itÕs nowhere near as long as Professor 
Dum
 ble
 doreÕs....Ó


Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all 
 talking 
spiritedly about the World Cup.
ÒItÕs got to be Ireland,Ó said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful 
of potato. Ò
!
ey ßattened Peru in the semiÞnals.Ó
ÒBulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,Ó said Fred.
ÒKrumÕs one decent player, Ireland has got seven,Ó said Charlie 
shortly. ÒI wish England had got through. 
!
at was embarrassing, 
that was.Ó
ÒWhat happened?Ó said Harry eagerly, regretting more than 
ever his isolation from the Wizarding world when he was stuck on 
Privet Drive.
ÒWent down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,Ó 
said Charlie gloomily. ÒShocking performance. And Wales lost to 
Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.Ó
Harry had been on the Gry
$
ndor House Quidditch team ever 
since his Þrst year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing 
brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to 
Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in 
the position of Seeker on the Gry
$
ndor House team.
Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden 
before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the 
time they had Þnished, moths were ßuttering low over the table, 
and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and hon-
eysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with 
the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rose-
bushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the 
family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, 
ÒSoÑ
have
 you heard from Sirius lately?Ó

Her
 mi one looked around, listening closely.
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry softly, Òtwice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him 
yesterday. He might write back while IÕm here.Ó
He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, 
and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Her
 mi one 
about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had 
 awoken 
him
 ... but he really didnÕt want to worry them just now, not when 
he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.
ÒLook at the time,Ó Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her 
wristwatch. ÒYou really should be in bed, the whole lot of youÑ
youÕll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you 
leave your school list out, IÕll get your things for you tomorrow in 
Diagon Alley. IÕm getting everyone elseÕs. 
!
ere might not be time 
after the World Cup, the match went on for Þve days last time.Ó
ÒWowÑhope it does this time!Ó said Harry enthusiastically.
ÒWell, I certainly donÕt,Ó said Percy sanctimoniously. ÒI 
shudder 
to think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from 
work for Þve days.Ó
ÒYeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?Ó 
said Fred.
Ò
!
at was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!Ó said Percy, going 
very red in the face. ÒIt was nothing 
personal
!ÓÒIt was,Ó Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. 
ÒWe sent it.Ó

 arry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in 
RonÕs room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs. 
Weasley.
ÒTime to go, Harry, dear,Ó she whispered, moving away to wake 
Ron.
Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up. It was 
still dark outside. Ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused 
him. At the foot of HarryÕs mattress he saw two large, disheveled 
shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.
ÒÕSÕ time already?Ó said Fred groggily.
!
ey dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and 
stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.
Mrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the 
stove, while Mr. Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf 
of large parchment tickets. He looked up as the boys entered and 
spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly. He 


was wearing what appeared to be a golÞng sweater and a very old 
pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick 
leather belt.
ÒWhat dÕyou think?Ó he asked anxiously. ÒWeÕre supposed to go 
incognitoÑdo I look like a Muggle, Harry?Ó
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry, smiling, Òvery good.Ó
ÒWhereÕre Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?Ó said George, fail-
ing to stiße a huge yawn.
ÒWell, theyÕre Apparating, arenÕt they?Ó said Mrs. Weasley, heav-
ing the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into 
bowls. ÒSo they can have a bit of a lie-in.Ó
Harry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place 
and reappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known 
any Hogwarts student to do it, and understood that it was very 
di
$
cult.
ÒSo theyÕre still in bed?Ó said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of 
porridge toward him. ÒWhy canÕt we Apparate too?Ó
ÒBecause youÕre not of age and you havenÕt passed your test,Ó 
snapped Mrs. Weasley. ÒAnd where have those girls got to?Ó
She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the 
stairs.
ÒYou have to pass a test to Apparate?Ó Harry asked.
ÒOh yes,Ó said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the 
back pocket of his jeans. Ò
!
e Department of Magical Transporta
-tion had to Þne a couple of people the other day for Apparating 
without a license. ItÕs not easy, Apparition, and when itÕs not done 
properly it can lead to nasty complications. 
!
is pair IÕm talking 
about went and Splinched themselves.Ó
Everyone around the table except Harry winced.

ÒErÑ
Splinched
?Ó said Harry.
Ò
!
ey left half of themselves behind,Ó said Mr. Weasley, now 
spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge. ÒSo, of course, 
they were stuck. CouldnÕt move either way. Had to wait for the Ac-
cidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old 
bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spot-
ted the body parts theyÕd left behind....Ó
Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying 
abandoned on the pavement of Privet Drive.
ÒWere they okay?Ó he asked, startled.
ÒOh yes,Ó said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. ÒBut they got a 
heavy Þne, and I donÕt think theyÕll be trying it again in a hurry. 
You donÕt mess around with Apparition. 
!
ere are plenty of adult 
wizards who donÕt bother with it. Prefer broomsÑslower, but 
safer.Ó
ÒBut Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?Ó
ÒCharlie had to take the test twice,Ó said Fred, grinning. ÒHe 
failed the Þrst time, Apparated Þve miles south of where he 
meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, 
remember?Ó
ÒYes, well, he passed the second time,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, march-
ing back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.
ÒPercy only passed two weeks ago,Ó said George. ÒHeÕs been 
 Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can.Ó
!
ere were footsteps down the passageway and Her
 mi one and 
Ginny came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
ÒWhy do we have to be up so early?Ó Ginny said, rubbing her 
eyes and sitting down at the table.
ÒWeÕve got a bit of a walk,Ó said Mr. Weasley.

ÒWalk?Ó said Harry. ÒWhat, are we walking to the World Cup?Ó
ÒNo, no, thatÕs miles away,Ó said Mr. Weasley, smiling. ÒWe only 
need to walk a short way. ItÕs just that itÕs very di
$
cult for a large 
number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle atten-
tion. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of 
times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World CupÑÓ
ÒGeorge!Ó said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.
ÒWhat?Ó said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.
ÒWhat is that in your pocket?Ó
ÒNothing!Ó
ÒDonÕt you lie to me!Ó
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at GeorgeÕs pocket and said, 
ÒAccio!Ó
Several small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of GeorgeÕs 
pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right 
into Mrs. WeasleyÕs outstretched hand.
ÒWe told you to destroy them!Ó said Mrs. Weasley furiously, 
holding up what were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue To
"
ees. 
ÒWe told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both 
of you!Ó
It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying 
to smuggle as many to
"
ees out of the house as possible, and it was 
only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed 
to Þnd them all.
ÒAccio! Accio! Accio!Ó 
she shouted, and to
"
ees zoomed from all 
sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of GeorgeÕs jacket and 
the turn-ups of FredÕs jeans.
ÒWe spent six months developing those!Ó Fred shouted at his 
mother as she threw the to
"
ees away.

ÒOh a Þne way to spend six months!Ó she shrieked. ÒNo wonder 
you didnÕt get more O.W.L.s!Ó
All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their 
departure. Mrs. Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Wea-
sley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who 
had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out 
without a word to her.
ÒWell, have a lovely time,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, Òand 
behave your-
selves,
Ó she called after the twinsÕ retreating backs, but they did 
not look back or answer. ÒIÕll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along 
around midday,Ó Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry, 
Ron, Her
 mi one, and Ginny set o
" across the dark yard after Fred 
and George.
It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish 
tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was 
drawing closer. Harry, having been thinking about thousands of 
wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World Cup, sped up to 
walk with Mr. Weasley.
ÒSo how 
does 
everyone get there without all the Muggles notic-
ing?Ó he asked.
ÒItÕs been a massive organizational problem,Ó sighed Mr. Wea-
sley. Ò
!
e trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up 
at the World Cup, and of course, we just havenÕt got a magical 
site big enough to accommodate them all. 
!
ere are places Mug-
gles canÕt penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand 
wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters.  
So we had to Þnd a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-
Muggle precautions as possible. 
!
e whole MinistryÕs been work-
ing on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the 

arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks be-
forehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we canÕt 
have too many clogging up their buses and trainsÑremember, 
wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of 
course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well 
away from Muggles. I believe thereÕs a handy wood theyÕre using 
as the Apparition point. For those who donÕt want to Apparate, or 
canÕt, we use Portkeys. 
!
eyÕre objects that are used to transport 
wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do 
large groups at a time if you need to. 
!
ere have been two hundred 
Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest 
one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so thatÕs where weÕre 
headed.Ó
Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass 
rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.
ÒWhat sort of objects are Portkeys?Ó said Harry curiously.
ÒWell, they can be anything,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒUnobtrusive 
things, obviously, so Muggles donÕt go picking them up and play-
ing with them
 ... stu
" theyÕll just think is litter....Ó
!
ey trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, 
the silence broken only by their footsteps. 
!
e sky lightened very 
slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky black-
ness diluting to deepest blue. HarryÕs hands and feet were freezing. 
Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.
!
ey didnÕt have breath to spare for talking as they began to 
climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit 
holes, slipping on thick black tu
"
ets of grass. Each breath Harry 
took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up 
when, at last, his feet found level ground.

ÒWhew,Ó panted Mr. Weasley, taking o
" his glasses and wiping 
them on his sweater. ÒWell, weÕve made good timeÑweÕve got ten 
minutes....Ó
Her
 mi one came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch 
in her side.
ÒNow we just need the Portkey,Ó said Mr. Weasley, replacing his 
glasses and squinting around at the ground. ÒIt wonÕt be big.
 ... Come on...Ó
!
ey spread out, searching. 
!
ey had only been at it for a couple 
of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.
ÒOver here, Arthur! Over here, son, weÕve got it!Ó
Two tall Þgures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the 
other side of the hilltop.
ÒAmos!Ó said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man 
who had shouted. 
!
e rest of them followed.
Mr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with 
a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a moldy-looking old boot 
in his other hand.
Ò
!
is is Amos Diggory, everyone,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒHe works 
for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical 
Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric?Ó
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around sev-
enteen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hu
#
epu
" House Quid-
ditch team at Hogwarts.
ÒHi,Ó said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nod
-ded. 
!
ey had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, 
Gry
$
ndor, in the Þrst Quidditch match of the previous year.
ÒLong walk, Arthur?Ó CedricÕs father asked.

ÒNot too bad,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒWe live just on the other side 
of the village there. You?Ó
ÒHad to get up at two, didnÕt we, Ced? I tell you, IÕll be glad 
when heÕs got his Apparition test. Still
 ... not complaining
 ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldnÕt miss it for a sackful of Gal
-leonsÑand the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got 
o
" easy....Ó Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the 
three Weasley boys, Harry, Her
 mi one, and Ginny. ÒAll these yours, 
Arthur?Ó
ÒOh no, only the redheads,Ó said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his 
children. Ò
!
is is Her
 mi one, friend of RonÕsÑand Harry, an-
other friendÑÓ
ÒMerlinÕs beard,Ó said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. ÒHarry? 
Harry 
Potter
?ÓÒErÑyeah,Ó said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they 
met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning 
scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.
ÒCedÕs talked about you, of course,Ó said Amos Diggory. ÒTold 
us all about playing against you last year.
 ... I said to him, I 
saidÑCed, thatÕll be something to tell your grandchildren, that 
will.
 ... You beat Harry Potter
!ÓHarry couldnÕt think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. 
Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly 
embarrassed.
ÒHarry fell o
" his broom, Dad,Ó he muttered. ÒI told you
 ... it 
was an accident....Ó
ÒYes, but 
you 
didnÕt fall o
"
, did you?Ó roared Amos genially, slap-
ping his son on his back. ÒAlways modest, our Ced, always the gen-

tleman
 ... but the best man won, IÕm sure HarryÕd say the same, 
wouldnÕt you, eh? One falls o
" his broom, one stays on, you donÕt 
need to be a genius to tell which oneÕs the better ßier!Ó
ÒMust be nearly time,Ó said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his 
watch again. ÒDo you know whether weÕre waiting for any more, 
Amos?Ó
ÒNo, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the 
Fawcetts couldnÕt get tickets,Ó said Mr. Diggory. Ò
!
ere arenÕt any 
more of us in this area, are there?Ó
ÒNot that I know of,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒYes, itÕs a minute 
o
"
....WeÕd better get ready....Ó
He looked around at Harry and Her
 mi one.
ÒYou just need to touch the Portkey, thatÕs all, a Þnger will doÑÓ
With di
$
culty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of 
them crowded around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.
!
ey all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over 
the hilltop. Nobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd 
this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now
 ... nine 
people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in 
the semidarkness, waiting.
 ... Ò
!
ree...Ó muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, 
Òtwo
 ... one...Ó
It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just be-
hind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His 
feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Her
 mi one on either side 
of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding for-
ward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his foreÞnger was stuck 
to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and 
thenÑ

His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and 
he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy 
thud.
Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were 
still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was 
on the ground.
ÒSeven past Þve from Stoatshead Hill,Ó said a voice.
There is a door
 at the end 
of a silent corridor. And itÕs haunting Harry 
PotterÕs dreams. Why else would he be waking in 
the middle of the night, screaming in terror?
Here are just a few things on HarryÕs mind:
A Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher 
with a personality like poisoned honeyA venomous, disgruntled house-elf
Ron as keeper of the GryfÞ ndor 
Quidditch team
The looming terror of the end-of-term 
Ordinary Wizarding Level exams
. . . and of course, the growing threat of 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. In the richest 
installment yet of J. K. RowlingÕs seven-part 
story, Harry Potter is faced with the unreliability 
of the very government of the magical world and 
the impotence of the authorities at Hogwarts. 
Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he 
Þ nds depth and strength in his friends, beyond 
what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and 
unbearable sacriÞ ce.
Though thick runs the plot (as well as the 
spine), readers will race through these pages and 
leave Hogwarts, like Harry, wishing only for the 
next train back.ALSO BY J. K. ROWLING:

HARRY POTTER
AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX
 ROWLING
ARTHUR A.LEVINE BOOKS SCHOLASTIC



he hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close 
and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet 
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives 
and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; 
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of 
their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants 
of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, win-
dows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. 
!
e only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying ßat on 
his back in a ßower bed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the 
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a 
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy 
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the up-
pers. Harry PotterÕs appearance did not endear him to the neighbors, 
who were the sort of people who thought scru
"
ness ought to be pun-
ishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea 
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only 


way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or 
Aunt Petunia 
stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight 
down into the ßower bed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his 
idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on 
the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or 
shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had 
tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his 
aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had ßuttered through the open win-
dow, Vernon Dursley, HarryÕs uncle, suddenly spoke. ÒGlad to see the 
boyÕs stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?Ó
ÒI donÕt know,Ó said 
Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. ÒNot in the 
house.Ó
Uncle Vernon grunted.
ÒWatching the news...Ó 
he said scathingly. ÒIÕd like to know what 
heÕs really up to. 
As if a normal boy cares whatÕs on the newsÑDud-
ley hasnÕt got a clue whatÕs going on, doubt he knows who the Prime 
Minister is! 
Anyway, itÕs not as if thereÕd be anything about 
his lot 
on 
our
 newsÑÓ
ÒVernon, 
shh
!Ó said 
Aunt Petunia. Ò
!
e windowÕs open!Ó
ÒOhÑyesÑsorry, dear...Ó
!
e Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ÕN 
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-
 loving 
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was 
frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was 
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking 
him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had 
rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle VernonÕs 
voice ßoated out of the window again.

ÒDudders out for tea?Ó
ÒAt the PolkissesÕ,Ó said 
Aunt Petunia fondly. ÒHeÕs got so many lit-
tle friends, heÕs so popular...Ó
Harry repressed a snort with di
"
culty. 
!
e Dursleys really were as-
tonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his 
dim-witted lies about having tea with a di
#
erent member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that 
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every 
evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and 
throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at 
it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent 
most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers 
from bins along the way.
!
e opening notes of the music that heralded the seven oÕclock 
news reached HarryÕs ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps 
 tonightÑafter a month of waitingÑwould be the nightÑ
ÒRecord numbers of stranded holidaymakers Þll airports as the 
Spanish baggage-handlersÕ strike reaches its second weekÑÓ
ÒGive Õem a lifelong siesta, I would,Ó snarled Uncle Vernon over the 
end of the newsreaderÕs sentence, but no matter: Outside in the ßower 
bed, HarryÕs stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, 
it would surely have been the Þrst item on the news; death and de-
struction were more important than stranded holidaymakers....
 He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. 
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expecta-
tion, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again...
 and 
always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of 
why
 noth
-ing had happened yet....
 He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not 
 recognized for what it really was by the MugglesÑan unex-
plained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident...
 but the 

 baggage-handlersÕ strike was followed by news on the drought in the 
Southeast (ÒI hope heÕs listening next door!Ó bellowed Uncle Vernon, 
Òwith his sprinklers on at three in the morning!Ó); then a helicopter 
that had almost crashed in a Þeld in Surrey, then a famous actressÕs di-
vorce from her famous husband (Òas if weÕre interested in their sordid 
a
#
airs,Ó sni
#
ed 
Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively 
in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the 
newsreader said, Ò
And Þnally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel 
way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feath-
ers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to Þnd 
out more....Ó
Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing 
 budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cau-
tiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows, 
preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in 
very quick succession.
A loud, echoing 
crack
 broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat 
streaked out from under a parked car and ßew out of sight; a shriek, a 
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Durs-
leysÕ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this 
 signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waist-
band of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a 
sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of 
his head collided with the DursleysÕ open window, and the resultant 
crash made 
Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he 
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, 
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple 
hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around 
his throat.

ÒPutÑitÑaway!Ó 
Uncle Vernon snarled into HarryÕs ear. 
ÒNow! 
BeforeÑanyoneÑsees!Ó
ÒGetÑo
#
Ñme!Ó Harry gasped; for a few seconds they strug-
gled, Harry pulling at his uncleÕs sausage-like Þngers with his left 
hand, his right maintaining a Þrm grip on his raised wand. 
!
en, as 
the pain in the top of HarryÕs head gave a particularly nasty throb, Un-
cle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an 
electric shockÑsome invisible force seemed to have surged through 
his nephew, making him impossible to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened 
up, and stared around. 
!
ere was no sign of what had caused the loud 
cracking
 noise, but there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stu
#
ed his wand hastily back into his jeans 
and tried to look innocent.
ÒLovely evening!Ó shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number 
Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. ÒDid you hear 
that car backÞre just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!Ó
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious 
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin 
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the 
point at which Uncle VernonÕs outstretched hands could resume their 
strangling.
ÒWhat the 
devil 
do you mean by it, boy?Ó asked Uncle Vernon in a 
croaky voice that trembled with fury.
ÒWhat do I mean by what?Ó said Harry coldly. He kept looking left 
and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made 
the cracking noise.
ÒMaking a racket like a starting pistol right outside ourÑÓ
ÒI didnÕt make that noise,Ó said Harry Þrmly.
Aunt PetuniaÕs thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Ver-
nonÕs wide, purple one. She looked livid.

ÒWhy were you lurking under our window?Ó
ÒYesÑyes, good point, Petunia! 
What were you doing under our 
window, boy?Ó
ÒListening to the news,Ó said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
ÒListening to the news! 
Again?Ó
ÒWell, it changes every day, you see,Ó said Harry.
ÒDonÕt you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what youÕre re-
ally up toÑand donÕt give me any more of this 
listening to the news 
tosh! You know perfectly well that 
your lot
...Ó
ÒCareful, Vernon!Ó breathed 
Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon low-
ered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, Ò...that 
your lot
 donÕt get on 
our 
news!Ó
Ò
!
atÕs all you know,Ó said Harry.
!
e Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then 
Aunt Petunia 
said, ÒYouÕre a nasty little liar. What are all thoseÑÓ she too lowered 
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, ÒÑ
owls
Ñdoing if theyÕre not bringing you news?Ó
ÒAha!Ó said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. ÒGet out of that 
one, boy! 
As if we didnÕt know you get all your news from those pesti
-lential birds!Ó
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the 
truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly 
know how bad Harry felt at admitting it.
Ò
!
e owls...
 arenÕt bringing me news,Ó said Harry tonelessly.
ÒI donÕt believe it,Ó said 
Aunt Petunia at once.
ÒNo more do I,Ó said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
ÒWe know youÕre up to something funny,Ó said 
Aunt Petunia.
ÒWeÕre not stupid, you know,Ó said Uncle Vernon.
ÒWell, 
thatÕs
 news to me,Ó said Harry, his temper rising, and before 
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the 

front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding o
# up 
the street.
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his 
aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not 
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing mat-
ters on his mind.
Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone 
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the 
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right 
at this very moment? 
As this thought occurred he wheeled around and 
stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely de-
serted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to 
become invisible....
 He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had 
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his fa-
vorite haunts automatically. 
Every few steps he glanced back over his 
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among 
Aunt 
PetuniaÕs dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadnÕt they spoken to 
him, why hadnÕt they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked 
away.
Perhaps it hadnÕt been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so 
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he 
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be 
sure
 it hadnÕt been the sound of something breaking in-
side a neighborÕs house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he 
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer 
rolled over him once again....
 Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at Þve 

oÕclock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the 
Daily Prophet
Ñbut was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced 
at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots 
who ran the paper Þnally realized that Vol
 de mort was back it would 
be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his 
best friends, Ron and Her
 mi one, though any expectation he had had 
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
ÒWe canÕt say much about you-know-what, obviously.
...Ó ÒWeÕve been 
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray.
...Ó ÒWeÕre quite busy but I canÕt give you details here....Ó Ò
!
ereÕs a fair 
amount going on, weÕll tell you everything when we see you.
...ÓBut when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too both-
ered with a precise date. Her
 mi one had scribbled, 
ÒI expect weÕll be 
seeing you quite soonÓ
 inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? 
As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Her
-mi one and Ron were in the same place, presumably at RonÕs parentsÕ 
house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun 
at the Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so 
angry at them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of 
Honeydukes chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this 
after eating the wilting salad 
Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner 
that night.
And what were Ron and Her
 mi one busy with? Why wasnÕt he, 
Harry, busy? HadnÕt he proved himself capable of handling much 
more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? HadnÕt it 
been 
he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed...
 ?DonÕt think about that, 
Harry told himself sternly for the 
 hundredth 
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the grave-
yard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments 
too.

He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he 
passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had 
Þrst clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to under-
stand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty 
of proper news as Ron and Her
 mi oneÕs, but at least they contained 
words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:
ÒI know this must be frustrating for you.
...Ó ÒKeep your nose clean 
and everything will be okay.
...Ó ÒBe careful and donÕt do anything 
rash.
...ÓWell, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into 
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had 
(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temp-
tation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set o
# for the Burrow 
by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good 
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet 
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in ßower beds in the hope of hear-
ing something that might point to what Lord Vol
 de mort was doing. 
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man 
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, 
Azkaban, escaped, 
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the 
Þrst place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogri
#
....
 Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set o
# across the 
parched grass. 
!
e park was as empty as the surrounding streets. 
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley 
and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around 
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to 
hide in the DursleysÕ ßower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to 
think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he 
had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, 
because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unset-
tling dreams about long dark corridors, all Þnishing in dead ends and 
locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the 

trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his 
forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that 
Ron or Her
 mi one or Sirius would Þnd that very interesting any-
more....
 In the past his scar hurting had warned that Vol
 de mort was 
getting stronger again, but now that Vol
 de mort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be ex-
pected....
 Nothing to worry about...
 old news...
 !
e injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell 
with fury. If it hadnÕt been for him, nobody would even have known 
Vol
 de mort was back! 
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whing-
ing for four solid weeks, completely cut o
# from the magical world, 
reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear 
about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dum
 ble
 dore have forgot-
ten him so easily? Why had Ron and Her
 mi one got together without 
inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure 
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the tempta-
tion to write to the stupid 
Daily Prophet
 and point out that Vol
 de-mort had returned? 
!
ese furious thoughts whirled around in HarryÕs 
head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell 
around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only 
sound that of the low grumble of tra
"
c on the road beyond the park 
railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the 
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. 
!
e street-
lamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the 
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. 
!
e others were 
laughing. 
A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing 
bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. 
!
e Þgure in front was unmis-
takably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accom-
panied by his faithful gang.

Dudley was as vast as ever, but a yearÕs hard dieting and the discov
-ery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. 
As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had 
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Cham-
pion of the Southeast. Ò
!
e noble sport,Ó as Uncle Vernon called it, 
had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry 
in the primary school days when he had served as DudleyÕs Þrst 
punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore 
but he still didnÕt think that Dudley learning to punch harder and 
more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terriÞed of himÑeven more terriÞed than they were of 
Òthat Potter boy,Ó who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooli-
gan who attended St. BrutusÕs Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys.
Harry watched the dark Þgures crossing the grass and wondered 
whom they had been beating up tonight. 
Look round, 
Harry found 
himself thinking as he watched them. 
Come on...
 look round...
 IÕm 
sitting here all alone.
... Come and have a go.
... If DudleyÕs friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to 
make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He 
wouldnÕt want to lose face in front of the gang, but heÕd be terriÞed of 
provoking Harry....
 It would be really fun to watch DudleyÕs 
 dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond
  ... and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was readyÑhe 
had his wand...
 let them try...
 HeÕd love to vent some of his frus-
tration on the boys who had once made his life hellÑ
But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were al-
most at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them. 
 ...Seeking a Þght was not a smart move....
 He must not use 
magic....
 He would be risking expulsion again....
 DudleyÕs gangÕs voices died; they were out of sight, heading along 
Magnolia Road.

!
ere you go, Sirius, 
Harry thought dully. 
Nothing rash. Kept my 
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what youÕd have done...
 He got to his feet and stretched. 
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon 
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to 
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had 
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley 
again, so, stißing a yawn, still scowling, Harry set o
# toward the park 
gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses 
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners 
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle VernonÕs. Harry preferred 
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches 
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hear-
ing disapproving mutters about his ÒdelinquentÓ appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along 
Magnolia Road DudleyÕs gang came into view again; they were saying 
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped 
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
Ò...squealed like a pig, didnÕt he?Ó Malcolm was saying, to 
 gu
#
aws 
from the others.
ÒNice right hook, Big D,Ó said Piers.
ÒSame time tomorrow?Ó said Dudley.
ÒRound at my place, my parents are out,Ó said Gordon.
ÒSee you then,Ó said Dudley.
ÒBye Dud!Ó
ÒSee ya, Big D!Ó
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting o
#
 again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the 
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon 
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his 
ease, humming tunelessly.
ÒHey, Big D!Ó

Dudley turned.
ÒOh,Ó he grunted. ÒItÕs you.Ó
ÒHow long have you been ÔBig DÕ then?Ó said Harry.
ÒShut it,Ó snarled Dudley, turning away again.
ÒCool name,Ó said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his 
cousin. ÒBut youÕll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.Ó
ÒI said, SHUT IT!Ó said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled 
into Þsts.
ÒDonÕt the boys know thatÕs what your mum calls you?Ó
ÒShut your face.Ó
ÒYou donÕt tell 
her 
to shut her face. What about ÔpopkinÕ and 
ÔDinky Diddydums,Õ can I use them then?Ó
Dudley said nothing. 
!
e e
#
ort of keeping himself from hitting 
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.
ÒSo whoÕve you been beating up tonight?Ó Harry asked, his grin 
fading. Ò
Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark 
Evans two nights 
agoÑÓ
ÒHe was asking for it,Ó snarled Dudley.
ÒOh yeah?Ó
ÒHe cheeked me.Ó
ÒYeah? Did he say you look like a pig thatÕs been taught to walk on 
its hind legs? ÕCause thatÕs not cheek, Dud, thatÕs true...Ó
A muscle was twitching in DudleyÕs jaw. It gave Harry enormous 
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as 
though he was siphoning o
# his own frustration into his cousin, the 
only outlet he had.
!
ey turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had 
Þrst seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia 
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the 
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. 
!
eir footsteps 
were mu
$
ed between garage walls on one side and a high fence on 
the other.

Ò
!
ink youÕre a big man carrying that thing, donÕt you?Ó Dudley 
said after a few seconds.
ÒWhat thing?Ó
Ò
!
atÑthat thing youÕre hiding.Ó
Harry grinned again.
ÒNot as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I sÕpose if you were, 
you wouldnÕt be able to walk and talk at the same time....Ó
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
ÒYouÕre not allowed,Ó Dudley said at once. ÒI know youÕre not. 
YouÕd get expelled from that freak school you go to.Ó
ÒHow dÕyou know they havenÕt changed the rules, Big D?Ó
Ò
!
ey havenÕt,Ó said Dudley, though he didnÕt sound completely 
convinced. Harry laughed softly.
ÒYou havenÕt got the guts to take me on without that thing, have 
you?Ó Dudley snarled.
ÒWhereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat 
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on 
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? 
Eight?Ó
ÒHe was sixteen for your information,Ó snarled Dudley, Òand he was 
out cold for twenty minutes after IÕd Þnished with him and he was 
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing 
outÑÓ
ÒRunning to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ fright-
ened of nasty HarryÕs wand?Ó
ÒNot this brave at night, are you?Ó sneered Dudley.
Ò
!
is 
is 
night, Diddykins. 
!
atÕs what we call it when it goes all 
dark like this.Ó
ÒI mean when youÕre in bed!Ó Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin. 
From the little he could see of DudleyÕs large face, he was wearing a 
strangely triumphant look.
ÒWhat dÕyou mean, IÕm not brave in bed?Ó said Harry, completely 

nonplussed. ÒWhatÑam I supposed to be frightened of pillows or 
something?Ó
ÒI heard you last night,Ó said Dudley breathlessly. ÒTalking in your 
sleep. 
Moaning.
ÓÒWhat dÕyou mean?Ó Harry said again, but there was a cold, plung-
ing sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night 
in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched, 
whimpering voice. ÒÔDonÕt kill Cedric! DonÕt kill Cedric!Õ WhoÕs 
 CedricÑyour boyfriend?Ó
ÒIÑyouÕre lyingÑÓ said Harry automatically. But his mouth had 
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasnÕt lyingÑhow else would he know 
about Cedric?
ÒÔDad! Help me, Dad! HeÕs going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!ÕÓ
ÒShut up,Ó said Harry quietly. ÒShut up, Dudley, IÕm warning you!Ó
ÒÔCome and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! HeÕs killed 
Cedric! Dad, help me! HeÕs going toÑÕ 
DonÕt you point that thing at 
me!
ÓDudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand 
directly at DudleyÕs heart. Harry could feel fourteen yearsÕ hatred of 
Dudley pounding in his veinsÑwhat wouldnÕt he give to strike now, 
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly heÕd have to crawl home like an insect, 
struck dumb, sprouting feelersÑ
ÒDonÕt ever talk about that again,Ó Harry snarled. ÒDÕyou under-
stand me?Ó
ÒPoint that thing somewhere else!Ó
ÒI said, 
do you understand me?
ÓÒPoint it somewhere else!Ó
ÒDO YOU UND
ERST
AND M
E?ÓÒGET TH
AT THING 
AWAY FROMÑÓ
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been 
doused in icy water.

Something had happened to the night. 
!
e star-strewn indigo sky 
was suddenly pitch-black and lightlessÑthe stars, the moon, the 
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. 
!
e distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. 
!
e balmy eve-
ning was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. 
!
ey were surrounded by 
total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had 
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without 
meaning to, despite the fact that heÕd been resisting as hard as he 
couldÑthen his reason caught up with his sensesÑhe didnÕt have 
the power to turn o
# the stars. He turned his head this way and that, 
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a 
 weightless veil.
DudleyÕs terriÞed voice broke in HarryÕs ear.
ÒW-what are you d
-doing? St
-stop it!Ó
ÒIÕm not doing anything! Shut up and donÕt move!Ó
ÒI c
-canÕt see! IÕve g
-gone blind! IÑÓ
ÒI said shut up!Ó
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. 
!
e cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had 
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were stand-
ing upÑhe opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly 
around, unseeing...
 It was impossible....
 !
ey couldnÕt be here....
 Not in Little 
 Whinging...
 He strained his ears....
 He would hear them before 
he saw them....
 ÒIÕll t
-tell Dad!Ó Dudley whimpered. ÒW
-where are you? What are 
you d
-doÑ?Ó
ÒWill you shut up?Ó Harry hissed, ÒIÕm trying to lisÑÓ
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been 
dreading.
!
ere was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some-

thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a hor-
rible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.
ÒC-cut it out! Stop doing it! IÕll h
-hit you, I swear I will!Ó
ÒDudley, shutÑÓ
WHAM! 
A Þst made contact with the side of HarryÕs head, lifting Harry o
#
 his feet. Small white lights popped in front of HarryÕs eyes; for the 
second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in 
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand 
had ßown out of his hand.
ÒYou moron, Dudley!Ó Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, 
as he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around franti-
cally in the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the 
alley fence, stumbling.
ÒDUDL
EY, COM
E BACK! YOUÕR
E RUNNING RIGHT 
AT IT!Ó
!
ere was a horrible squealing yell, and DudleyÕs footsteps stopped. 
At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that 
could mean only one thing. 
!
ere was more than one.
ÒDUDL
EY, K
EEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WH
ATEVER YOU 
DO, K
EEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!Ó Harry muttered fran-
tically, his hands ßying over the ground like spiders. ÒWhereÕsÑ
wandÑcome onÑ
Lumos!Ó
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in 
his searchÑand to his disbelieving relief, light ßared inches from 
his right handÑthe wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, 
scrambled to his feet, and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded Þgure was gliding smoothly toward him, hov-
ering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking 
on the night as it came.
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.

ÒExpecto Patronum!Ó
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the de-
mentor slowed, but the spell hadnÕt worked properly; tripping over his 
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, 
panic fogging his brainÑ
concentrate 
Ñ A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementorÕs 
robes, reaching for him. 
A rushing noise Þlled HarryÕs ears.
ÒExpecto Patronum!Ó
His voice sounded dim and distant....
 Another wisp of silver 
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wandÑhe couldnÕt do 
it anymore, he couldnÕt work the spellÑ
!
ere was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laugh-
ter....
 He could smell the dementorÕs putrid, death-cold breath, Þll-
ing his own lungs, drowning himÑ
!ink...
 something happy.
...But there was no happiness in him....
 !
e dementorÕs icy Þngers 
were closing on his throatÑthe high-pitched laughter was growing 
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his headÑ
ÒBow to death, 
Harry.
... It might even be painless....
 I would not know....
 I have 
never died....Ó 
He was never going to see Ron and Her
 mi one againÑ
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for 
breathÑ
ÒEXPECTO PATRONUM!Ó
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of HarryÕs wand; its 
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have 
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag 
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
ÒTHIS W
AY!Ó Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he 
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. ÒDUDL
EY? 
DUDL
EY!Ó
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley 
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second 

dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy 
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded 
head toward DudleyÕs face as though about to kiss him....
 ÒGET IT!Ó Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the 
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. 
!
e de
-mentorÕs eyeless face was barely an inch from DudleyÕs when the silver 
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its 
 fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. 
!
e stag 
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. 
A warm breeze 
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mun-
dane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent Þlled the air again. Harry 
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to 
normality. 
After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was stick-
ing to him; he was drenched in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors 
here, 
in 
Little Whinging...
 Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. 
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a Þt state to stand up, but 
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising 
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her 
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string 
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway 
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hur-
riedly out of sight, butÑ
ÒDonÕt put it away, idiot boy!Ó she shrieked. ÒWhat if there are 
more of them around? Oh, IÕm going to 
kill
 Mundungus Fletcher!Ó

 hat?Ó said Harry blankly.
ÒHe left!Ó said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. ÒLeft to see 
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell o
# the back of a broom! 
I told him IÕd ßay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! ItÕs 
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbles on the case! But we havenÕt got time to 
stand around! Hurry, now, weÕve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble 
this is going to cause! I will 
kill 
him!Ó
ÒButÑÓ
!
e revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what 
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of 
them down the alleyway. ÒYouÕreÑyouÕre a 
witch
?ÓÒIÕm a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was 
I supposed to help you Þght o
# dementors? He left you completely 
without cover when I 
warned 
himÑÓ
Ò
!
is bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang onÑit 
was 
him
! He Disapparated from the front of my house!Ó
ÒYes, yes, 
yes, 
but luckily IÕd stationed Mr. Tibbles under a car just 
in case, and Mr. Tibbles came and warned me, but by the time I got 


to your house youÕd goneÑand nowÑoh, 
whatÕs
 Dum
 ble
 dore go-
ing to say? You!Ó she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley ßoor. 
ÒGet your fat bottom o
# the ground, quick!Ó
ÒYou know Dum
 ble
 dore?Ó said Harry, staring at her.
ÒOf course I know Dum
 ble
 dore, who doesnÕt know Dum
 ble
 dore? 
But come 
onÑIÕll be no help if they come back, IÕve never so much 
as TransÞgured a teabagÑÓ
She stooped down, seized one of DudleyÕs massive arms in her wiz-
ened hands, and tugged.
ÒGet 
up, 
you useless lump, get 
up!ÓBut Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on 
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.
ÒIÕll do it.Ó Harry took hold of DudleyÕs arm and heaved: With 
an enormous e
#
ort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley 
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in 
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let 
go of him he swayed dangerously.
ÒHurry up!Ó said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of DudleyÕs massive arms around his own shoul-
ders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his 
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously 
around the corner.
ÒKeep your wand out,Ó she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria 
Walk. ÒNever mind the Statute of Secrecy now, thereÕs going to be hell 
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk 
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery ...
 !
is was 
exactly 
what Dum
 ble
 dore was afraid ofÑwhatÕs that at the end of the 
street? Oh, itÕs just Mr. Prentice. ...
 DonÕt put your wand away, boy, 
donÕt I keep telling you IÕm no use?Ó
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at 
the same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but 
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He 

was slumped on HarryÕs shoulder, his large feet dragging along the 
ground.
ÒWhy didnÕt you tell me youÕre a Squib?Ó Harry asked Mrs. Figg, 
panting with the e
#
ort to keep walking. Ò
All those times I came round 
your houseÑwhy didnÕt you say anything?Ó
ÒDum
 ble
 doreÕs orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say any-
thing, you were too young. IÕm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, 
but the Dursleys would never have let you come if theyÕd thought you 
enjoyed it. It wasnÕt easy, you know. ...
 But oh my word,Ó she said 
tragically, wringing her hands once more, Òwhen Dum
 ble
 dore hears 
about thisÑhow could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be 
on duty until midnightÑ
where is he?
 How am I going to tell Dum
-ble
 dore whatÕs happened, I canÕt 
ApparateÑÓ
ÒIÕve got an owl, you can borrow her,Ó Harry groaned, wondering 
whether his spine was going to snap under DudleyÕs weight.
ÒHarry, you donÕt understand! Dum
 ble
 dore will need to act as 
quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting 
underage magic, theyÕll know already, you mark my wordsÑÓ
ÒBut I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magicÑtheyÕre 
going to be more worried what dementors were doing ßoating around 
Wisteria Walk, surely?Ó
ÒOh my dear, I wish it were so but IÕm afraidÑMUNDUNGUS 
FLETCH
ER, I 
AM GOING TO KILL YOU!Ó
!
ere was a loud 
crack 
and
 a strong smell of mingled drink and 
stale tobacco Þlled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered over-
coat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long 
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the dole-
ful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that 
Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak.
ÒÕSÕ up, Figgy?Ó he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dud-
ley. ÒWhat Õappened to staying undercover?Ó

ÒIÕll give you undercover!Ó cried Mrs. Figg. Ò
Dementors,
 you 
 useless, 
skiving sneak thief!Ó
ÒDementors?Ó repeated Mundungus, aghast. ÒDementors here?Ó
ÒYes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!Ó shrieked Mrs. 
Figg. ÒDementors attacking the boy on your watch!Ó
ÒBlimey,Ó said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to 
Harry and back again. ÒBlimey, I...Ó
ÒAnd you o
# buying stolen cauldrons! DidnÕt I tell you not to go? 
DidnÕt I?
ÓÒIÑwell, IÑÓ Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. ÒIt ...
 it was a very good business opportunity, see...Ó
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and 
whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by 
the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.
ÒOuchÑgerro
#
Ñgerro
#
, you mad old bat! SomeoneÕs gotta tell 
Dum
 ble
 dore!Ó
ÒYesÑtheyÑhave!Ó yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of 
cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. Ò
AndÑitÑ
hadÑbetterÑbeÑyouÑandÑyouÑcanÑtellÑhimÑ
whyÑyouÑwerenÕtÑthereÑtoÑhelp!Ó
ÒKeep your Õairnet on!Ó said Mundungus, his arms over his head, 
cowering. ÒIÕm going, IÕm going!Ó
And with another loud 
crack, 
he vanished.
ÒI hope Dum
 ble
 dore 
murders 
him!Ó said Mrs. Figg furiously. ÒNow 
come 
on, 
Harry, what are you waiting for?Ó
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out 
that he could barely walk under DudleyÕs bulk. He gave the semicon-
scious Dudley a heave and staggered onward.
ÒIÕll take you to the door,Ó said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet 
Drive. ÒJust in case there are more of them around. ...
 Oh my word, 
what a catastrophe ...
 and you had to Þght them o
# yourself ...
 and 

Dum
 ble
 dore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs. 
... Well, itÕs no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose ...

ÒSo,Ó Harry panted, ÒDum

 me 
followed?Ó
ÒOf course he has,Ó said Mrs. Figg impatiently. ÒDid you expect 
him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in 
June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. ...
 Right 
... get inside and stay there,Ó she said as they reached number four. ÒI 
expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.Ó
ÒWhat are you going to do?Ó asked Harry quickly.
ÒIÕm going straight home,Ó said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark 
street and shuddering. ÒIÕll need to wait for more instructions. Just 
stay in the house. Good night.Ó
ÒHang on, donÕt go yet! I want to knowÑÓ
But Mrs. Figg had already set o
# at a trot, carpet slippers ßopping, 
string bag clanking.
ÒWait!Ó Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask 
anyone who was in contact with Dum
 ble
 dore; but within seconds 
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted 
Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number 
fourÕs garden path.
!
e hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waist-
band of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched 
Aunt PetuniaÕs outline 
grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the 
front door.
ÒDiddy! 
About time too, I was getting quiteÑquiteÑ
Diddy, 
whatÕs the matter?
ÓHarry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his 
arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face 
pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the 
doormat.

ÒDIDDY! Diddy, whatÕs the matter with you? Vernon? V
ERNON!Ó
HarryÕs uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mus
-tache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated. 
He hurried forward to help 
Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed Dud
-ley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.
ÒHeÕs ill, Vernon!Ó
ÒWhat is it, son? WhatÕs happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you 
something foreign for tea?Ó
ÒWhy are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on 
the ground?Ó
ÒHang onÑyou havenÕt been mugged, have you, son?Ó
Aunt Petunia screamed.
ÒPhone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak 
to Mummy! What did they do to you?Ó
In all the kerfu
$
e, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which 
suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Ver-
non slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy prog-
ress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and 
quietly toward the stairs.
ÒWho did it, son? Give us names. WeÕll get them, donÕt worry.Ó
ÒShh! HeÕs trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? 
Tell Mummy!Ó
HarryÕs foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his 
voice.
ÒHim.Ó
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the 
explosion.
ÒBOY! COM
E HERE!ÓWith a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot 
slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
!
e scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the 
darkness outside. 
Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he 

was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing 
in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, nar-
rowed eyes.
ÒWhat have you done to my son?Ó he said in a menacing growl.
ÒNothing,Ó said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon 
wouldnÕt believe him.
ÒWhat did he do to you, Diddy?Ó 
Aunt Petunia said in a quavering 
voice, now sponging sick from the front of DudleyÕs leather jacket. 
ÒWas itÑwas it you-know-what, darling? Did he useÑhis 
thing?
ÓSlowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
ÒI didnÕt!Ó Harry said sharply, as 
Aunt Petunia let out a wail and 
Uncle Vernon raised his Þsts. ÒI didnÕt do anything to him, it wasnÕt 
me, it wasÑÓ
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the 
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle VernonÕs head, 
it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it 
was carrying in its beak at HarryÕs feet, and turned gracefully, the tips 
of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside 
again and o
# across the garden.
ÒOWLS!Ó bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his tem-
ple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. ÒOWLS 
AGAIN! I WILL NOT H
AVE ANY MOR
E OWLS IN MY 
HOUS
E!ÓBut Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out 
the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his 
AdamÕs apple.
Dear Mr. Potter,

tronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening

Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware 
of Uncle Vernon and 
Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his 
head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his conscious-
ness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all 
over. He was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, 
shouting, his Þsts still raised; 
Aunt Petunia had her arms around 
Dudley, who was retching again.
HarryÕs temporarily stupeÞed brain seemed to reawaken. 
Ministry 
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy 
your wand. 
!
ere was only one thing for it. He would have to runÑ
now. Where he was going to go, Harry didnÕt know, but he was 
 certain 
of one thing: 
At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an 
almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the 
kitchen.

ÒWhere dÕyou think youÕre going?Ó yelled Uncle Vernon. When 
Harry didnÕt reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the door-
way into the hall. ÒI havenÕt Þnished with you, boy!Ó
ÒGet out of the way,Ó said Harry quietly.
ÒYouÕre going to stay here and explain how my sonÑÓ
ÒIf you donÕt get out of the way IÕm going to jinx you,Ó said Harry, 
raising the wand.
ÒYou canÕt pull that one on me!Ó snarled Uncle Vernon. ÒI know 
youÕre not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!Ó
Ò
!
e madhouse has chucked me out,Ó said Harry. ÒSo I can do 
whatever I like. YouÕve got three seconds. OneÑtwoÑÓ
A resounding 
CRACK
 Þlled the kitchen; 
Aunt Petunia screamed, 
Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night 
Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. 
He spotted it at once: 
A dazed and ru
$
ed-looking barn owl was sit-
ting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed 
window.
Ignoring Uncle VernonÕs anguished yell of ÒOWLS!Ó Harry crossed 
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. 
!
e owl 
stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook 
its feathers, and took o
# the moment Harry had pulled o
# the letter. 
Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was writ-
ten very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry Ñ
Dum
 ble
 doreÕs just arrived at the Ministry, and heÕs 
 trying 
to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND 
 UNCLEÕS HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC. 
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.

Dum
 ble
 dore was trying to sort it all out. ...
 What did that mean? 
How much power did Dum
 ble
 dore have to override the Ministry of 
Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hog-
warts, then? 
A small shoot of hope burgeoned in HarryÕs chest, almost 
immediately strangled by panicÑhow was he supposed to refuse to 
surrender his wand without doing magic? HeÕd have to duel with the 
Ministry representatives, and if he did that, heÕd be lucky to escape 
Azkaban, let alone expulsion.
His mind was racing. ...
 He could run for it and risk being cap-
tured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to Þnd him here. 
He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that 
Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart ...
 and, after all, Dum
 ble
-dore had sorted out much worse than this before. ...
 ÒRight,Ó Harry said, ÒIÕve changed my mind, IÕm staying.Ó
He ßung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley 
and 
Aunt Petunia. 
!
e Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt 
change of mind. 
Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. 
!
e vein in Uncle VernonÕs purple temple was throbbing worse than 
ever.
ÒWho are all these ruddy owls from?Ó he growled.
Ò
!
e Þrst one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,Ó said 
Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case 
the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and 
quieter to answer Uncle VernonÕs questions than to have him start rag-
ing and bellowing. Ò
!
e second one was from my friend RonÕs dad, he 
works at the Ministry.Ó
ÒMinistry of Magic?Ó 
bellowed Uncle Vernon. ÒPeople like you in 
government
? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the 
countryÕs going to the dogs....Ó
When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then 
spat, Ò
And why have you been expelled?Ó

ÒBecause I did magic.Ó
ÒAHA!Ó roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his Þst down on the top of 
the fridge, which sprang open; several of DudleyÕs low-fat snacks top-
pled out and burst on the ßoor. ÒSo you admit it! 
What did you do to 
Dudley?Ó
ÒNothing,Ó said Harry, slightly less calmly. Ò
!
at wasnÕt meÑÓ
ÒWas,Ó
 muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and 
Aunt Petunia instantly made ßapping gestures at Harry to quiet him 
while they both bent low over Dudley.
ÒGo on, son,Ó said Uncle Vernon, Òwhat did he do?Ó
ÒTell us, darling,Ó whispered 
Aunt Petunia.
ÒPointed his wand at me,Ó Dudley mumbled.
ÒYeah, I did, but I didnÕt useÑÓ Harry began angrily, but...
 ÒSHUT UP!Ó roared Uncle Vernon and 
Aunt Petunia in uni-
son. ÒGo on, son,Ó repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about 
furiously.
ÒAll dark,Ó Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. Ò
Everything dark. 
And then I h-heard ...
 things. 
Inside m-my head...Ó
Uncle Vernon and 
Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. 
If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed 
by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, 
people who heard voices were deÞnitely in the bottom ten. 
!
ey obvi-
ously thought Dudley was losing his mind.
ÒWhat sort of things did you hear, popkin?Ó breathed 
Aunt Petu-
nia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and 
shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that 
had settled on Harry since the arrival of the Þrst owl, he felt a certain 
curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of 
their life. ...
 What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have 
been forced to hear?
ÒHow come you fell over, son?Ó said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-

rally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a 
very ill person.
ÒT-tripped,Ó said Dudley shakily. Ò
And thenÑÓ
He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was re-
membering the clammy cold that Þlled the lungs as hope and happi-
ness were sucked out of you.
ÒHorrible,Ó croaked Dudley. ÒCold. Really cold.Ó
ÒOkay,Ó said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while 
Aunt 
Petunia laid an anxious hand on DudleyÕs forehead to feel his temper
-ature. ÒWhat happened then, Dudders?Ó
ÒFelt ...
 felt ...
 felt ...
 as if ...
 as if...Ó
ÒAs if youÕd never be happy again,Ó Harry supplied tonelessly.
ÒYes,Ó Dudley whispered, still trembling.
ÒSo,Ó said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable 
volume as he straightened up. ÒSo you put some crackpot spell on my 
son so heÕd hear voices and believe he wasÑwas doomed to misery, 
or something, did you?Ó
ÒHow many times do I have to tell you?Ó said Harry, temper and 
voice rising together. Ò
It wasnÕt me! 
It was a couple of dementors!Ó
ÒA couple ofÑwhatÕs this codswallop?Ó
ÒDeÑmenÑtors,Ó said Harry slowly and clearly. ÒTwo of 
them.Ó
ÒAnd what the ruddy hell are dementors?Ó
Ò
!
ey guard the wizard prison, 
Azkaban,Ó said 
Aunt Petunia.
Two secondsÕ ringing silence followed these words and then 
Aunt 
Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip 
a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. HarryÕs 
brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thingÑbut 
Aunt Petunia
?ÒHow dÕyou know that?Ó he asked her, astonished.
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at 
Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to 
reveal her horsey teeth.

ÒI heardÑthat awful boyÑtelling 
her 
about themÑyears ago,Ó 
she said jerkily.
ÒIf you mean my mum and dad, why donÕt you use their names?Ó 
said Harry loudly, but 
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed hor-
ribly ßustered.
Harry was stunned. 
Except for one outburst years ago, in the course 
of which 
Aunt Petunia had screamed that HarryÕs mother had been 
a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was astounded 
that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical 
world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretend-
ing it didnÕt exist.
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once 
more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, 
opened it for a third time and croaked, ÒSoÑsoÑtheyÑerÑ
theyÑerÑthey actually exist, do theyÑerÑdementy-whatsits?Ó
Aunt Petunia nodded.
Uncle Vernon looked from 
Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if 
hoping somebody was going to shout Ò
April Fool!Ó When nobody did, 
he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to Þnd 
more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which 
zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball 
and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the 
Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second o
"
cial-looking 
envelope from the owlÕs beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped 
back out into the night.
ÒEnoughÑe
"
ngÑ
owls
...Ó muttered Uncle Vernon distract-
edly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes 
ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy 
your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your 

disciplinary hearing on 
%*
th 
August, at which time an o
"
cial 
decision will be taken.
Following discussions with the headmaster of Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed 
that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that 
time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from 
school pending further inquiries.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,

Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. 
!
e miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he 
was not deÞnitely expelled, though his fears were by no means ban-
ished. 
Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of 
August.
ÒWell?Ó said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings. 
ÒWhat now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have 
the death penalty?Ó he added as a hopeful afterthought.
ÒIÕve got to go to a hearing,Ó said Harry.
ÒAnd theyÕll sentence you there?Ó
ÒI suppose so.Ó
ÒI wonÕt give up hope, then,Ó said Uncle Vernon nastily.
ÒWell, if thatÕs all,Ó said Harry, getting to his feet. He was 
 desperate 
to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Her
 mi one, or 
Sirius.
ÒNO, IT RUDDY W
ELL IS NOT 
ALL!Ó bellowed Uncle Vernon. 
ÒSIT B
ACK DOWN!Ó

ÒWhat 
now
?Ó said Harry impatiently.
ÒDUDL
EY!Ó roared Uncle Vernon. ÒI want to know exactly what 
happened to my son!Ó
ÒFIN
E!Ó yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot 
out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. 
All three Durs-
leys ßinched, looking terriÞed.
ÒDudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent 
and Wisteria Walk,Ó said Harry, speaking fast, Þghting to control 
his temper.
 ÒDudley thought heÕd be smart with me, I pulled out my 
wand but didnÕt use it. 
!
en two dementors turned upÑÓ
ÒBut what 
ARE dementoids?Ó asked Uncle Vernon furiously. 
ÒWhat do they DO?Ó
ÒI told youÑthey suck all the happiness out of you,Ó said Harry, 
Òand if they get the chance, they kiss youÑÓ
ÒKiss you?Ó said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. Ò
Kiss 
you?Ó
ÒItÕs what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.Ó
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.
ÒHis 
soul
? !
ey didnÕt takeÑheÕs still got hisÑÓ
She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though test
-ing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.
ÒOf course they didnÕt get his soul, youÕd know if they had,Ó said 
Harry, exasperated.
ÒFought Õem o
#
, did you, son?Ó said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the 
appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a 
plane he understood. ÒGave Õem the old one-two, did you?Ó
ÒYou canÕt give a dementor 
the old one-two,
Ó said Harry through 
clenched teeth.
ÒWhyÕs he all right, then?Ó blustered Uncle Vernon. ÒWhy isnÕt he 
all empty, then?Ó
ÒBecause I used the PatronusÑÓ 
WHOOSH.
 With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of 
dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen Þreplace.

ÒFOR GODÕS S
AKE!Ó roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps 
of hair out of his mustache, something he hadnÕt been driven to in 
a long time. ÒI WILL NOT H
AVE OWLS H
ERE, I WILL NOT 
TOL
ERATE THIS, I T
ELL YOU!Ó
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owlÕs 
leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dum
 ble
 dore, 
explaining everythingÑthe dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Min-
istry was up to, how he, Dum
 ble
 dore, intended to sort everything 
outÑthat for the Þrst time in his life he was disappointed to see Sir-
iusÕs handwriting. Ignoring Uncle VernonÕs ongoing rant about owls 
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most re-
cent owl took o
# back up the chimney, Harry read SiriusÕs message.
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that 
had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, 
looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing there. 
And now his temper was rising again. WasnÕt 
anybody
 going to say 
Òwell doneÓ for Þghting o
# two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr. 
Weasley and Sirius were acting as though heÕd misbehaved and they 
were saving their tellings-o
# until they could ascertain how much 
damage had been done.
ÒÑa peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house 
and I wonÕt have it, boy, I wonÕtÑÓ
ÒI canÕt stop the owls coming,Ó Harry snapped, crushing SiriusÕs let-
ter in his Þst.
ÒI want the truth about what happened tonight!Ó barked Uncle 
Vernon. ÒIf it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come youÕve 
been expelled? You did you-know-what, youÕve admitted it!Ó
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to 

ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, 
away from the Dursleys.
ÒI did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,Ó he said, 
forcing himself to remain calm. ÒItÕs the only thing that works against 
them.Ó
ÒBut what were dementoids 
doing 
in Little Whinging?Ó said Uncle 
Vernon in tones of outrage.
ÒCouldnÕt tell you,Ó said Harry wearily. ÒNo idea.Ó
His head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. His 
anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. 
!
e Dursleys were 
all staring at him. 
ÒItÕs you,Ó said Uncle Vernon forcefully. ÒItÕs got something to do 
with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else 
would they be down that alleyway? YouÕve got to be the onlyÑthe 
onlyÑÓ 
Evidently he couldnÕt bring himself to say the word 
 Òwizard.Ó 
Ò
!
e only 
you-know-what
 for miles.Ó
ÒI donÕt know why they were here....Ó
But at these words of Uncle VernonÕs, HarryÕs exhausted brain 
ground back into action. Why 
had
 the dementors come to Little 
 Whinging? How 
could 
it be coincidence that they had arrived in the 
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of 
Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted 
Azkaban and 
joined Vol
 de mort, as Dum
 ble
 dore had predicted they would?
Ò
!
ese demembers guard some weirdosÕ prison?Ó said Uncle Ver-
non, lumbering in the wake of HarryÕs train of thought.
ÒYes,Ó said Harry.
If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the 
kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and 
think.
 ...
 ÒOho! 
!
ey were coming to arrest you!Ó said Uncle Vernon, with 
the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. 
Ò
!
atÕs it, isnÕt it, boy? YouÕre on the run from the law!Ó

ÒOf course IÕm not,Ó said Harry, shaking his head as though to 
scare o
# a ßy, his mind racing now.
Ò
!
en whyÑ?Ó
ÒHe must have sent them,Ó said Harry quietly, more to himself 
than to Uncle Vernon.
ÒWhatÕs that? Who must have sent them?Ó
ÒLord Vol
 de mort,Ó said Harry.
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who 
ßinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like Òwizard,Ó 
Òmagic,Ó or Òwand,Ó could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all 
time without the slightest tremor.
ÒLordÑhang on,Ó said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look 
of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. ÒIÕve heard that name 
... that was the one who...Ó
ÒMurdered my parents, yes,Ó Harry said.
ÒBut heÕs gone,Ó said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slight-
est sign that the murder of HarryÕs parents might be a painful topic to 
anybody. Ò
!
at giant bloke said so. HeÕs gone.Ó
ÒHeÕs back,Ó said Harry heavily.
It felt very strange to be standing here in 
Aunt PetuniaÕs surgically 
clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen 
television, and talking calmly of Lord Vol
 de mort to Uncle Vernon. 
!
e arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have 
caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly 
non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. HarryÕs two 
lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned up-
side down: 
!
e Dursleys were asking for details about the magical 
world and Mrs. Figg knew 
Albus Dum
 ble
 dore; dementors were soar-
ing around Little Whinging and he might never go back to 
 Hogwarts. 
HarryÕs head throbbed more painfully.
ÒBack?Ó whispered 
Aunt Petunia.

She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. 
And all of a sudden, for the very Þrst time in his life, Harry fully ap-
preciated that 
Aunt Petunia was his motherÕs sister. He could not have 
said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. 
All he knew 
was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling 
of what Lord Vol
 de mort being back might mean. 
Aunt Petunia had 
never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so 
unlike her sisterÕs) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: 
!
ey were 
wide and fearful. 
!
e furious pretense that 
Aunt Petunia had main-
tained all HarryÕs lifeÑthat there was no magic and no world other 
than the world she inhabited with Uncle VernonÑseemed to have 
fallen away.
ÒYes,Ó Harry said, talking directly to 
Aunt Petunia now. ÒHe came 
back a month ago. I saw him.Ó
Her hands found DudleyÕs massive leather-clad shoulders and 
clutched them.
ÒHang on,Ó said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and 
back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented un-
derstanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. ÒHang on. 
!
is Lord VoldythingÕs back, you say.Ó
ÒYes.Ó
Ò
!
e one who murdered your parents.Ó
ÒYes.Ó
ÒAnd now heÕs sending dismembers after you?Ó
ÒLooks like it,Ó said Harry.
ÒI see,Ó said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to 
Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his 
great purple face stretching before HarryÕs eyes. ÒWell, that settles it,Ó 
he said, his shirt front straining as he inßated himself, 
Òyou can get out 
of this house, boy!Ó
ÒWhat?Ó said Harry.
ÒYou heard meÑOUT!Ó Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even 
Aunt 

Petunia and Dudley jumped. ÒOUT! OUT! I shouldÕve done it years 
ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half 
the lounge destroyed, DudleyÕs tail, Marge bobbing around on the 
ceiling, and that ßying Ford 
AngliaÑOUT! OUT! YouÕve had it! 
YouÕre history! YouÕre not staying here if some loonyÕs after you, youÕre 
not endangering my wife and son, youÕre not bringing trouble down 
on us, if youÕre going the same way as your useless parents, IÕve had it! 
OUT!Ó
Harry stood rooted to the spot. 
!
e letters from the Ministry, 
Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. 
DonÕt leave the 
house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND 
 UNCLEÕS HOUSE.
ÒYou heard me!Ó said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that 
his massive purple face came closer to HarryÕs, so that Harry actually 
felt ßecks of spit hit his face. ÒGet going! You were all keen to leave 
half an hour ago! IÕm right behind you! Get out and never darken our 
doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the Þrst place I donÕt know. 
Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too 
damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, 
thought we could turn you normal, but youÕve been rotten from the 
beginning, and IÕve had enoughÑOWLS!Ó
!
e Þfth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the 
ßoor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry 
raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but 
it soared straight over his head, ßying directly at 
Aunt Petunia, who let 
out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. 
!
e owl dropped the 
red envelope on her head, turned, and ßew straight up the chimney 
again.
Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but 
Aunt Petunia beat 
him to it.
ÒYou can open it if you like,Ó said Harry, Òbut IÕll hear what it says 
anyway. 
!
atÕs a Howler.Ó

ÒLet go of it, Petunia!Ó roared Uncle Vernon. ÒDonÕt touch it, it 
could be dangerous!Ó
ÒItÕs addressed to me,Ó said 
Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. ÒItÕs 
addressed to 
me, 
Vernon, look! 
Mrs. Petunia Dursley, 
!
e Kitchen, 
Number Four, Privet Drive
ÑÓShe caught her breath, horriÞed. 
!
e red envelope had begun to 
smoke.
ÒOpen it!Ó Harry urged her. ÒGet it over with! ItÕll happen 
anywayÑÓ
ÒNoÑÓ
Aunt PetuniaÕs hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the 
kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too lateÑthe en-
velope burst into ßames. 
Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it. 
An awful voice Þlled the kitchen, echoing in the conÞned space, 
issuing from the burning letter on the table.
ÒREMEMBER
 MY LAST
, PETUNIA
.ÓAunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the 
chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. 
!
e remains of the enve-
lope smoldered into ash in the silence.
ÒWhat is this?Ó Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. ÒWhatÑI donÕtÑ 
Petunia?Ó
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his 
mother, his mouth hanging open. 
!
e silence spiraled horribly. Harry 
was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing Þt to 
burst.
ÒPetunia, dear?Ó said Uncle Vernon timidly. ÒP-Petunia?Ó
She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.
Ò
!
e boyÑthe boy will have to stay, Vernon,Ó she said weakly.
ÒW-what?Ó

ÒHe stays,Ó she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her 
feet again.
ÒHe ...
 but Petunia...Ó
ÒIf we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,Ó she said. She was re-
gaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still 
very pale. Ò
!
eyÕll ask awkward questions, theyÕll want to know where 
heÕs gone. WeÕll have to keep him.Ó
Uncle Vernon was deßating like an old tire.
ÒBut Petunia, dearÑÓ
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.
ÒYouÕre to stay in your room,Ó she said. ÒYouÕre not to leave the 
house. Now get to bed.Ó
Harry didnÕt move.
ÒWho was that Howler from?Ó
ÒDonÕt ask questions,Ó 
Aunt Petunia snapped.
ÒAre you in touch with wizards?Ó
ÒI told you to get to bed!Ó
ÒWhat did it mean? Remember the last what?Ó
ÒGo to bed!Ó
ÒHow comeÑ?Ó
ÒYOU H
EARD YOUR 
AUNT, NOW G
ET TO B
ED!Ó

Õve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from 
Hogwarts. I want to know whatÕs going on and when IÕm going to get 
out of here.
Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment 
the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed 
the Þrst to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Her
 mi one. His 
owl, Hedwig, was o
# hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. 
Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head 
pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and 
itched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home, 
and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit 
him were throbbing painfully.
Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, 
grinding his teeth and clenching his Þsts, casting angry looks out at 
the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Demen-
tors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him 
in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Minis-
try of MagicÑand 
still 
no one was telling him what was going on.


And what, 
what,
 had that Howler been about? Whose voice had 
echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?
Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was ev-
eryone treating him like some naughty kid? 
DonÕt do any more magic, 
stay in the house.
 ...
  He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his 
anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with 
in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.
Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with 
a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.
ÒAbout time!Ó Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her 
cage. ÒYou can put that down, IÕve got work for you!Ó
HedwigÕs large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over 
the dead frog clamped in her beak.
ÒCome here,Ó said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parch-
ment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. ÒTake 
these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Her
 mi one and donÕt come back here 
without good long replies. Keep pecking them till theyÕve written 
 decent-length answers if youÕve got to. Understand?Ó
Hedwig gave a mu
$
ed hooting noise, beak still full of frog.
ÒGet going, then,Ó said Harry.
She took o
# immediately. 
!
e moment sheÕd gone, Harry threw 
himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark 
ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty 
that heÕd been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at 
number four, Privet Drive. But heÕd make it up to her when she came 
back with SiriusÕs, RonÕs, and Her
 mi oneÕs answers.
!
ey were bound to write back quickly; they couldnÕt possibly ig-
nore a dementor attack. HeÕd probably wake up tomorrow to three fat 
letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the 
Burrow. 
And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stißing 
all further thought.

But Hedwig didnÕt return next morning. Harry spent the day in his 
bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. 
!
ree times that day 
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat ßap Uncle 
Vernon had installed three summers ago. 
Every time Harry heard her 
approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might 
as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. 
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldnÕt 
see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would 
achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry heÕd perform 
more illegal magic.
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was Þlled alternately with 
restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during 
which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them 
for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete 
that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into 
space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
What if they ruled against him? What if he 
was
 expelled and his 
wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? 
He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now 
that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. 
...Was it possible that he might be able to move into SiriusÕs house, 
as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to ßee 
from the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone, 
given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he 
went next be decided for him; had his breach of the International 
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in 
Azka-
ban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid o
# his 
bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after HedwigÕs departure Harry was lying in 
one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind 

quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly 
around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expres-
sion of enormous smugness.
ÒWeÕre going out,Ó he said.
ÒSorry?Ó
ÒWeÑthat is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and IÑare going out.Ó
ÒFine,Ó said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
ÒYou are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.Ó
ÒOkay.Ó
ÒYou are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our 
possessions.Ó
ÒRight.Ó
ÒYou are not to steal food from the fridge.Ó
ÒOkay.Ó
ÒI am going to lock your door.Ó
ÒYou do that.Ó
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of ar-
gument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind 
him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle VernonÕs foot-
steps walking heavily down the stairs. 
A few minutes later he heard the 
slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the 
 unmistakable 
sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made 
no di
#
erence to him whether they were in the house or not. He could 
not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. 
!
e room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the 
night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting 
for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
!
e empty house creaked around him. 
!
e pipes gurgled. Harry 
lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in 
misery.
And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.

He sat bolt upright, listening intently. 
!
e Dursleys couldnÕt be 
back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadnÕt heard their car.
!
ere was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.
Burglars,
 he thought, sliding o
# the bed onto his feetÑbut a split 
second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices 
down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly 
not troubling to do so.
He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood fac-
ing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he 
jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.
Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark 
upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. 
He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of 
his room to the head of the stairs.
His heart shot upward into his throat. 
!
ere were people standing 
in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing 
through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could 
see, looking up at him.
ÒLower your wand, boy, before you take someoneÕs eye out,Ó said a 
low, growling voice.
HarryÕs heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, 
but he did not lower his wand.
ÒProfessor Moody?Ó he said uncertainly.
ÒI donÕt know so much about ÔProfessor,ÕÓ growled the voice, Ònever 
got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you 
properly.Ó
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, 
nor did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had 
recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-
Eye 
MoodyÕs company only to Þnd out that it wasnÕt Moody at all, but an 
impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before 

being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to 
do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice ßoated upstairs.
ÒItÕs all right, Harry. WeÕve come to take you away.Ó
HarryÕs heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadnÕt heard 
it for more than a year.
ÒP-Professor Lupin?Ó he said disbelievingly. ÒIs that you?Ó
ÒWhy are we all standing in the dark?Ó said a third voice, this one 
completely unfamiliar, a womanÕs. 
ÒLumos.Ó
A wand-tip ßared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry 
blinked. 
!
e people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, 
gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. 
!
ough still quite young, 
 Lupin 
looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry 
had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shab-
bier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who 
tried to smile back through his shock.
ÒOooh, he looks just like I thought he would,Ó said the witch who 
was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had 
a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair 
that was a violent shade of violet. ÒWotcher, Harry!Ó
ÒYeah, I see what you mean, Remus,Ó said a bald black wizard 
standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single 
gold hoop in his ear. ÒHe looks exactly like James.Ó
ÒExcept the eyes,Ó said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the 
back. ÒLilyÕs eyes.Ó
Mad-
Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk 
missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through 
his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the 
other large, round, and electric blueÑthe magical eye that could see 
through walls, doors, and the back of MoodyÕs own head.
ÒAre you quite sure itÕs him, Lupin?Ó he growled. ÒItÕd be a nice 

lookout if we bring back some Death 
Eater impersonating him. We 
ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless 
anyone brought any Veritaserum?Ó
ÒHarry, what form does your Patronus take?Ó said Lupin.
ÒA stag,Ó said Harry nervously.
Ò
!
atÕs him, Mad-
Eye,Ó said Lupin.
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring 
at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
ÒDonÕt put your wand there, boy!Ó roared Moody. ÒWhat if it ig-
nited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!Ó
ÒWho dÕyou know whoÕs lost a buttock?Ó the violet-haired woman 
asked Mad-
Eye interestedly.
ÒNever you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!Ó 
growled Mad-
Eye. Ò
Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers about it 
anymore....Ó He stumped o
#
 toward the kitchen. Ò
And I saw that,Ó 
he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.
Lupin held out his hand and shook HarryÕs.
ÒHow are you?Ó he asked, looking at Harry closely.
ÒF-Þne...Ó
Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with noth-
ing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, 
and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly 
in the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He 
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly 
at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his 
hair for four days.
ÒIÕmÑyouÕre really lucky the Dursleys are out...Ó he mumbled.
ÒLucky, ha!Ó said the violet-haired woman. ÒIt was me that lured 
them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them theyÕd 
been short-listed for the 
All-
England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn 
Competition. 
!
eyÕre heading o
# to the prize-giving right now. ...
 Or they think they are.Ó

Harry had a ßeeting vision of Uncle VernonÕs face when he realized 
there was no 
All-
England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
ÒWe are leaving, arenÕt we?Ó he asked. ÒSoon?Ó
ÒAlmost at once,Ó said Lupin, ÒweÕre just waiting for the all-clear.Ó
ÒWhere are we going? 
!
e Burrow?Ó Harry asked hopefully.
ÒNot the Burrow, no,Ó said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the 
kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curi-
ously. ÒToo risky. WeÕve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable. 
ItÕs taken a while....Ó
Mad-
Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging 
from a hip ßask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in 
the DursleysÕ many labor-saving appliances.
Ò
!
is is 
Alastor Moody, Harry,Ó Lupin continued, pointing toward 
Moody.
ÒYeah, I know,Ó said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be intro-
duced to somebody heÕd thought heÕd known for a year.
ÒAnd this is NymphadoraÑÓ
ÒDonÕt 
call me Nymphadora, Remus,Ó said the young witch with a 
shudder. ÒItÕs Tonks.Ó
ÒÑNymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname 
only,Ó Þnished Lupin.
ÒSo would you if your fool of a mother had called you ÔNympha-
dora,ÕÓ muttered Tonks.
ÒAnd this is Kingsley ShackleboltÓÑhe indicated the tall black 
wizard, who bowedÑÒ
Elphias DogeÓÑthe wheezy-voiced wizard 
noddedÑÒDedalus DiggleÑÓ
ÒWeÕve met before,Ó squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his 
top hat.
ÒÑEmmeline VanceÓÑa stately looking witch in an emerald-
green shawl inclined her headÑÒSturgis PodmoreÓÑa square-jawed 
wizard with thick, straw-colored hair winkedÑÒand Hestia Jones.Ó 
A pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.

Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were 
introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; 
it was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also won-
dered why so many of them were there.
ÒA surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,Ó 
said Lupin, as though he had read HarryÕs mind; the corners of his 
mouth twitched slightly.
ÒYeah, well, the more the better,Ó said Moody darkly. ÒWeÕre your 
guard, Potter.Ó
ÒWeÕre just waiting for the signal to tell us itÕs safe to set o
#
,Ó said 
Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. ÒWeÕve got about Þfteen 
minutes.Ó
ÒVery 
clean,
 arenÕt they, these Muggles?Ó said the witch called 
Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. ÒMy 
dadÕs Muggle-born and heÕs a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just 
like with wizards?Ó
ÒErÑyeah,Ó said Harry. ÒLookÓÑhe turned back to LupinÑ
ÒwhatÕs going on, I havenÕt heard anything from anyone, whatÕs VolÑ?Ó
Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Ded-
alus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, 
ÒShut up!Ó
ÒWhat?Ó said Harry.
ÒWeÕre not discussing anything here, itÕs too risky,Ó said Moody, 
turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing 
up at the ceiling. 
ÒDamn it,Ó 
he added angrily, putting a hand up to the 
magical eye, Òit keeps stickingÑever since that scum wore itÑÓ
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being 
pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.
ÒMad-
Eye, you do know thatÕs disgusting, donÕt you?Ó said Tonks 
conversationally.
ÒGet me a glass of water, would you, Harry?Ó asked Moody.
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and Þlled it 

with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. 
!
eir relentless staring was starting to annoy him.
ÒCheers,Ó said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He 
dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and 
down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. ÒI want 
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.Ó
ÒHowÕre we gettingÑwherever weÕre going?Ó Harry asked.
ÒBrooms,Ó said Lupin. ÒOnly way. YouÕre too young to 
Apparate, 
theyÕll be watching the Floo Network, and itÕs more than our lifeÕs 
worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.Ó
ÒRemus says youÕre a good ßier,Ó said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his 
deep voice.
ÒHeÕs excellent,Ó said Lupin, who was checking his watch. Ò
Any-
way, youÕd better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go 
when the signal comes.Ó
ÒIÕll come and help you,Ó said Tonks brightly.
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking 
around with much curiosity and interest.
ÒFunny place,Ó she said, ÒitÕs a bit 
too
 clean, dÕyou know what I 
mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,Ó she added, as they entered 
HarryÕs bedroom and he turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. 
ConÞned to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not both
-ered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn 
over the ßoor where heÕd tried to distract himself with each in turn and 
thrown it aside. HedwigÕs cage needed cleaning out and was starting to 
smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle 
clothes and wizardÕs robes that had spilled onto the ßoor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his 
trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her re-
ßection in the mirror on the inside of the door.

ÒYou know, I donÕt think purpleÕs really my color,Ó she said pen-
sively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. ÒDÕyou think it makes me look 
a bit peaky?Ó
ÒErÑÓ said Harry, looking up at her over the top of 
Quidditch 
Teams of Britain and Ireland.
ÒYeah, it does,Ó said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a 
strained expression as though she were struggling to remember some-
thing. 
A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.
ÒHow did you do that?Ó said Harry, gaping at her as she opened 
her eyes again.
ÒIÕm a Metamorphmagus,Ó she said, looking back at her reßection 
and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. 
ÒIt means I can change my appearance at will,Ó she added, spotting 
HarryÕs puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. ÒI was born one. 
I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during 
Auror training 
without any study at all, it was great.Ó
ÒYouÕre an 
Auror?Ó said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard 
catcher was the only career heÕd ever considered after Hogwarts.
ÒYeah,Ó said Tonks, looking proud. ÒKingsley is as well; heÕs a bit 
higher up than I am, though. I only qualiÞed a year ago. Nearly failed 
on Stealth and Tracking, IÕm dead clumsy, did you hear me break that 
plate when we arrived downstairs?Ó
ÒCan you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?Ó Harry asked her, 
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
ÒBet you wouldnÕt mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?Ó
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on HarryÕs forehead.
ÒNo, I wouldnÕt mind,Ó Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not 
like people staring at his scar.
ÒWell, youÕll have to learn the hard way, IÕm afraid,Ó said Tonks. 
ÒMetamorphmagi are really rare, theyÕre born, not made. Most wiz-
ards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. ...
  
But weÕve got to get going, Harry, weÕre supposed to be packing,Ó she 
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the ßoor.
ÒOhÑyeah,Ó said Harry, grabbing up a few more books.
ÒDonÕt be stupid, itÕll be much quicker if IÑ
pack
!Ó cried Tonks, 
waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the ßoor.
Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and ßew 
pell-mell into the trunk.
ÒItÕs not very neat,Ó said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and 
looking down at the jumble inside. ÒMy mumÕs got this knack of 
getting stu
# to Þt itself in neatlyÑshe even gets the socks to fold 
themselvesÑbut IÕve never mastered how she does itÑitÕs a kind 
of ßickÑÓ
She ßicked her wand hopefully; one of HarryÕs socks gave a feeble 
sort of wiggle and ßopped back on top of the mess within.
ÒAh, well,Ó said Tonks, slamming the trunkÕs lid shut, Òat least itÕs 
all in. 
!
at could do with a bit of cleaning, tooÑ
ScourgifyÑ
Ó She 
pointed her wand at HedwigÕs cage; a few feathers and droppings van-
ished. ÒWell, thatÕs a 
bit 
betterÑIÕve never quite got the hang of 
these sort of householdy spells. RightÑgot everything? Cauldron? 
Broom? Wow! 
A Firebolt
?ÓHer eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in HarryÕs right 
hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international stan-
dard broomstick.
ÒAnd IÕm still riding a Comet Two Sixty,Ó said Tonks enviously. 
ÒAh well ...
 wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, 
letÕs go. 
Locomotor Trunk.
ÓHarryÕs trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like 
a conductorÕs baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of 
the door ahead of them, HedwigÕs cage in her left hand. Harry fol-
lowed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was 
spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley 

 Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and 
Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while 
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the 
Dursleys.
ÒExcellent,Ó said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. 
ÒWeÕve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into 
the garden so weÕre ready. Harry, IÕve left a letter telling your aunt and 
uncle not to worryÑÓ
Ò
!
ey wonÕt,Ó said Harry.
Ò
!
at youÕre safeÑÓ
Ò
!
atÕll just depress them.Ó
ÒÑand youÕll see them next summer.Ó
ÒDo I have to?Ó
Lupin smiled but made no answer.
ÒCome here, boy,Ó said Moody gru
$y, beckoning Harry toward 
him with his wand. ÒI need to Disillusion you.Ó
ÒYou need to what?Ó said Harry nervously.
ÒDisillusionment Charm,Ó said Moody, raising his wand. ÒLupin 
says youÕve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it wonÕt stay on while weÕre 
ßying; thisÕll disguise you better. Here you goÑÓ
He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curi-
ous sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold 
trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand 
had struck.
ÒNice one, Mad-
Eye,Ó said Tonks appreciatively, staring at HarryÕs 
midri
#
.Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, 
for it didnÕt look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had 
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind 
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.
ÒCome on,Ó said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
!
ey all stepped outside onto Uncle VernonÕs beautifully kept lawn.

ÒClear night,Ó grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heav-
ens. ÒCouldÕve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,Ó he 
barked at Harry, ÒweÕre going to be ßying in close formation. TonksÕll 
be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. LupinÕll be covering 
you from below. IÕm going to be behind you. 
!
e restÕll be circling us. 
We donÕt break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killedÑÓ
ÒIs that likely?Ó Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored 
him.
ÒÑthe others keep ßying, donÕt stop, donÕt break ranks. If they 
take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing 
by to take over; keep ßying east and theyÕll join you.Ó
ÒStop being so cheerful, Mad-
Eye, heÕll think weÕre not taking this 
seriously,Ó said Tonks, as she strapped HarryÕs trunk and HedwigÕs 
cage into a harness hanging from her broom.
ÒIÕm just telling the boy the plan,Ó growled Moody. ÒOur jobÕs to 
deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attemptÑÓ
ÒNo oneÕs going to die,Ó said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, 
calming voice.
ÒMount your brooms, thatÕs the Þrst signal!Ó said Lupin sharply, 
pointing into the sky.
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had ßared among 
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung 
his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it 
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in 
the air once more.
ÒSecond signal, letÕs go!Ó said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green 
this time, exploded high above them.
Harry kicked o
# hard from the ground. 
!
e cool night air rushed 
through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, 
shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and 
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as 
though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though 

his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was ßying again, ßy-
ing away from Privet Drive as heÕd been fantasizing about all summer, 
he was going home. ...
 For a few glorious moments, all his problems 
seemed to recede into nothing, insigniÞcant in the vast, starry sky.
ÒHard left, hard left, thereÕs a Muggle looking up!Ó shouted Moody 
from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching 
his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. ÒWe need more height. 
... Give it another quarter of a mile!Ó
HarryÕs eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see 
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights 
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Ver-
nonÕs car. ...
 !
e Dursleys would be heading back to their empty 
house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn 
 competition 
...and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was 
drowned by the ßapping of the othersÕ robes, the creaking of the har-
ness holding his trunk and the cage, the 
whoosh
 of the wind in their 
ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, 
or this happy. ...
 ÒBearing south!Ó shouted Mad-
Eye. ÒTown ahead!Ó
!
ey soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glit-
tering spiderweb of lights below.
ÒBear southeast and keep climbing, thereÕs some low cloud ahead 
we can lose ourselves in!Ó called Moody.
ÒWeÕre not going through clouds!Ó shouted Tonks angrily. ÒWeÕll 
get soaked, Mad-
Eye!Ó
Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing 
numb on the FireboltÕs handle. He wished he had thought to put on a 
coat; he was starting to shiver.
!
ey altered their course every now and then according to Mad-
EyeÕs instructions. HarryÕs eyes were screwed up against the rush of 
icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember 
being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch 

match against Hu
$
epu
# in his third year, which had taken place in 
a storm. 
!
e guard around him was circling continuously like giant 
birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they 
had been ßying; it felt like an hour at least.
ÒTurning southwest!Ó yelled Moody. ÒWe want to avoid the 
motorway!Ó
Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment 
of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even 
more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfort-
able to spin around in Þreplaces but it was at least warm in the ßames. 
... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring 
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. ...
 Now 
Emmeline Vance was on 
his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right ...
 then she 
too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. ...
 ÒWe ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure weÕre not be-
ing followed!Ó Moody shouted.
ÒARE YOU M
AD, M
AD-EYE?Ó Tonks screamed from the front. 
ÒWeÕre all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going o
# course weÕre not 
going to get there until next week! WeÕre nearly there now!Ó
ÒTime to start the descent!Ó came LupinÕs voice. ÒFollow Tonks, 
Harry!Ó
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. 
!
ey were heading for the 
 largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, criss-
crossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches 
of deepest black. Lower and lower they ßew, until Harry could see in-
dividual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. 
He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that 
someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.
ÒHere we go!Ó called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch 
of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already 
unbuckling HarryÕs trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. 
!
e grimy 

fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them 
had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-
lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of 
 rubbish 
lay outside several sets of front steps.
ÒWhere are we?Ó Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, ÒIn a minute.Ó
Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy 
with cold.
ÒGot it,Ó he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette 
lighter into the air and clicking it.
!
e nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the un-
lighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every 
lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square 
came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.
ÒBorrowed it from Dum
 ble
 dore,Ó growled Moody, pocketing the 
Put-Outer. Ò
!
atÕll take care of any Muggles looking out of the win-
dow, see? Now, come on, quick.Ó
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, 
across the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed, 
carrying HarryÕs trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with 
their wands out, ßanking them.
!
e mu
$
ed pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper win-
dow in the nearest house. 
A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came 
from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.
ÒHere,Ó Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward 
HarryÕs Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as 
to illuminate the writing. ÒRead quickly and memorize.Ó
Harry looked down at the piece of paper. 
!
e narrow handwriting 
was vaguely familiar. It said:
The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at 
number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.

 hatÕs the Order of theÑ?Ó Harry began.
ÒNot here, boy!Ó snarled Moody. ÒWait till weÕre inside!Ó
He pulled the piece of parchment out of HarryÕs hand and set Þre 
to it with his wand-tip. 
As the message curled into ßames and ßoated 
to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. 
!
ey were 
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number 
ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.
ÒBut whereÕsÑ?Ó
Ò
!
ink about what youÕve just memorized,Ó said Lupin quietly.
Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-
ber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of 
nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by 
dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had 
inßated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at 
it. 
!
e stereo in number eleven thudded on. 
Apparently the Muggles 
inside hadnÕt even felt anything.
ÒCome on, hurry,Ó growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.



Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materi-
alized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. 
!
e silver door 
knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. 
!
ere was no keyhole 
or letterbox.
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard 
many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a 
chain. 
!
e door creaked open.
ÒGet in quick, Harry,Ó Lupin whispered. ÒBut donÕt go far inside 
and donÕt touch anything.Ó
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of 
the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the 
place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder 
and saw the others Þling in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his 
trunk and HedwigÕs cage. Moody was standing on the top step and 
releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street
-lamps; they ßew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed 
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed 
the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.
ÒHereÑÓ
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt 
as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and 
knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
ÒNow stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,Ó 
Moody whispered.
!
e othersÕ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of fore-
boding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying 
person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas 
lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a ßickering insub-
stantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a 
long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered over-
head and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry 


heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier 
and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
!
ere were hurried footsteps and RonÕs mother, Mrs. Weasley, 
emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in 
welcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she 
was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen 
her.
ÒOh, Harry, itÕs lovely to see you!Ó she whispered, pulling him into 
a rib-cracking hug before holding him at armÕs length and examining 
him critically. ÒYouÕre looking peaky; you need feeding up, but youÕll 
have to wait a bit for dinner, IÕm afraid....Ó
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered ur-
gently, ÒHeÕs just arrived, the meetingÕs started....Ó
!
e wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excite-
ment and began Þling past Harry toward the door through which 
Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. 
Weasley held him back.
ÒNo, Harry, the meetingÕs only for members of the Order. Ron and 
Her
 mi one are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meetingÕs 
over and then weÕll have dinner. 
And keep your voice down in the 
hall,Ó she added in an urgent whisper.
ÒWhy?Ó
ÒI donÕt want to wake anything up.Ó
ÒWhat dÕyouÑ?Ó
ÒIÕll explain later, IÕve got to hurry, IÕm supposed to be at the meet-
ingÑIÕll just show you where youÕre sleeping.Ó
Pressing her Þnger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of 
long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must 
be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked 
as though it had been made from a severed trollÕs leg, they started up 
 the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on 
 
plaques on the wall. 
A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged 
to house-elves. 
All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.
HarryÕs bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on 
earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to 
the Darkest of wizards?
ÒMrs. Weasley, whyÑ?Ó
ÒRon and Her
 mi one will explain everything, dear, IÕve really got 
to dash,Ó Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. Ò
!
ereÓÑthey had 
reached the second landingÑÒyouÕre the door on the right. IÕll call 
you when itÕs over.Ó
And she hurried o
# downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, 
which was shaped like a serpentÕs head, and opened the door.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded 
room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even 
louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quan-
tity of very bushy hairÑHer
 mi one had thrown herself onto him in a 
hug that nearly knocked him ßat, while RonÕs tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, 
zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
ÒHARRY! Ron, heÕs here, HarryÕs here! We didnÕt hear you arrive! 
Oh, how 
are 
you? 
Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? 
I bet you have, I know our letters were uselessÑbut we couldnÕt tell 
you anything, Dum
 ble
 dore made us swear we wouldnÕt, oh, weÕve got 
so much to tell you, and youÕve got to tell usÑthe dementors! When 
we heardÑand that Ministry hearingÑitÕs just outrageous, IÕve 
looked it all up, they canÕt expel you, they just canÕt, thereÕs provision 
in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of 
magic in life-threatening situationsÑÓ
ÒLet him breathe, Her
 mi one,Ó said Ron, grinning, closing the door 
behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during 
their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than 
ever, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.


Her
 mi one, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say 
another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white 
soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on HarryÕs 
shoulder.
ÒHedwig!Ó
!
e snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear a
#
ectionately 
as Harry stroked her feathers.
ÒSheÕs been in a right state,Ó said Ron. ÒPecked us half to death 
when she brought your last letters, look at thisÑÓ
He showed Harry the index Þnger of his right hand, which sported 
a half-healed but clearly deep cut.
ÒOh yeah,Ó Harry said. ÒSorry about that, but I wanted answers, 
you know....Ó
ÒWe wanted to give them to you, mate,Ó said Ron. ÒHer
 mi one was 
going spare, she kept saying youÕd do something stupid if you were 
stuck all on your own without news, but Dum
 ble
 dore made usÑÓ
ÒÑswear not to tell me,Ó said Harry. ÒYeah, Her
 mi oneÕs already 
said.Ó
!
e warm glow that had ßared inside him at the sight of his two 
best friends was extinguished as something icy ßooded the pit of his 
stomach. 
All of a suddenÑafter yearning to see them for a solid 
monthÑhe felt he would rather Ron and Her
 mi one left him alone.
!
ere was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig auto-
matically, not looking at either of the others.
ÒHe seemed to think it was best,Ó said Her
 mi one rather breath-
lessly. ÒDum
 ble
 dore, I mean.Ó
ÒRight,Ó said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks 
of HedwigÕs beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
ÒI think he thought you were safest with the MugglesÑÓ Ron 
began.
ÒYeah?Ó said Harry, raising his eyebrows. ÒHave either of you been 
attacked by dementors this summer?Ó

ÒWell, noÑbut thatÕs why heÕs had people from the Order of the 
Phoenix tailing you all the timeÑÓ
Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a 
step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed 
except him.
ÒDidnÕt work that well, though, did it?Ó said Harry, doing his 
utmost to keep his voice even. ÒHad to look after myself after all,  
didnÕt I?Ó
ÒHe was so angry,Ó said Her
 mi one in an almost awestruck voice. 
ÒDum
 ble
 dore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left 
before his shift had ended. He was scary.Ó
ÒWell, IÕm glad he left,Ó Harry said coldly. ÒIf he hadnÕt, I wouldnÕt 
have done magic and Dum
 ble
 dore would probably have left me at 
Privet Drive all summer.Ó
ÒArenÕt you ...
 arenÕt you worried about the Ministry of Magic 
hearing?Ó said Her
 mi one quietly.
ÒNo,Ó Harry lied deÞantly. He walked away from them, looking 
around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this 
room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. 
A blank 
stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the 
bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he 
heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.
ÒSo whyÕs Dum
 ble
 dore been so keen to keep me in the dark?Ó 
Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. ÒDid youÑ
erÑbother to ask him at all?Ó
He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told 
him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing 
to improve his temper.
ÒWe told Dum
 ble
 dore we wanted to tell you what was going on,Ó 
said Ron. ÒWe did, mate. But heÕs really busy now, weÕve only seen 
him twice since we came here and he didnÕt have much time, he just 


made us swear not to tell you important stu
# when we wrote, he said 
the owls might be interceptedÑÓ
ÒHe could stillÕve kept me informed if heÕd wanted to,Ó Harry said 
shortly. ÒYouÕre not telling me he doesnÕt know ways to send messages 
without owls.Ó
Her
 mi one glanced at Ron and then said, ÒI thought that too. But 
he didnÕt want you to know 
anything.
ÓÒMaybe he thinks I canÕt be trusted,Ó said Harry, watching their 
expressions.
ÒDonÕt be thick,Ó said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
ÒOr that I canÕt take care of myselfÑÓ
ÒOf course he doesnÕt think that!Ó said Her
 mi one anxiously.
ÒSo how come I have to stay at the DursleysÕ while you two get to 
join in everything thatÕs going on here?Ó said Harry, the words tum-
bling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every 
word. ÒHow come you two are allowed to know everything thatÕs go-
ing onÑ?Ó
ÒWeÕre not!Ó Ron interrupted. ÒMum wonÕt let us near the meet-
ings, she says weÕre too youngÑÓ
But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.

Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past 
month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the 
hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being 

followed and not told about it: 
All the feelings he was half-ashamed 
of Þnally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and 
soared o
# on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in 
alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.

ÒNo, honestÑÓ
ÒHarry, weÕre really sorry!Ó said Her
 mi one desperately, her eyes now 
sparkling with tears. ÒYouÕre absolutely right, HarryÑIÕd be furious 
if it was me!Ó
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from 
them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the 
top of the wardrobe. 
!
ere was a long pause, broken only by the 
mournful creak of the ßoorboards below HarryÕs feet.


ÒWhat 
is this place anyway?Ó he shot at Ron and Her
 mi one.
ÒHeadquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,Ó said Ron at once.
ÒIs anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the 
PhoenixÑ?Ó
ÒItÕs a secret society,Ó said Her
 mi one quickly. ÒDum
 ble
 doreÕs in 
charge, he founded it. ItÕs the people who fought against You-Know-
Who last time.Ó
ÒWhoÕs in it?Ó said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his 
pockets.
ÒQuite a few peopleÑÓ
ÒÑweÕve met about twenty of them,Ó said Ron, Òbut we think 
there are more....Ó
Harry glared at them.
ÒWell?Ó
 he demanded, looking from one to the other.
ÒEr,Ó said Ron. ÒWell what?Ó
ÒVol
 de mort!Ó
 said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Her
 mi one 
winced. ÒWhatÕs happening? WhatÕs he up to? Where is he? What are 
we doing to stop him?Ó
ÒWeÕve 
told
 you, the Order donÕt let us in on their meetings,Ó said 
Her
 mi one nervously. ÒSo we donÕt know the detailsÑbut weÕve got a 
general ideaÑÓ she added hastily, seeing the look on HarryÕs face.
ÒFred and George have invented 
Extendable 
Ears, see,Ó said Ron. 
Ò
!
eyÕre really useful.Ó
ÒExtendableÑ?Ó
ÒEars, yeah. Only weÕve had to stop using them lately because 
Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them 
all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of 
them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the 
Order are following known Death 
Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you 
knowÑÓ
ÒÑsome of them are working on recruiting more people to the 
OrderÑÓ said Her
 mi one.

ÒÑand some of them are standing guard over something,Ó said 
Ron. Ò
!
eyÕre always talking about guard duty.Ó
ÒCouldnÕt have been me, could it?Ó said Harry sarcastically.
ÒOh yeah,Ó said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking any-
where but at Ron and Her
 mi one. ÒSo what have you two been doing, 
if youÕre not allowed in meetings?Ó he demanded. ÒYou said youÕd 
been busy.Ó
ÒWe have,Ó said Her
 mi one quickly. ÒWeÕve been decontaminating 
this house, itÕs been empty for ages and stu
#
Õs been breeding in here. 
WeÕve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I 
think weÕre doing the drawing room tomoÑ
AARGH!Ó
With two loud cracks, Fred and George, RonÕs elder twin brothers, 
had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidg
-eon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed o
# to join Hedwig 
on top of the wardrobe.
ÒStop 
doing 
that!Ó Her
 mi one said weakly to the twins, who were as 
vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.
ÒHello, Harry,Ó said George, beaming at him. ÒWe thought we 
heard your dulcet tones.Ó
ÒYou donÕt want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all 
out,Ó said Fred, also beaming. Ò
!
ere might be a couple of people Þfty 
miles away who didnÕt hear you.Ó
ÒYou two passed your 
Apparation tests, then?Ó asked Harry 
grumpily.
ÒWith distinction,Ó said Fred, who was holding what looked like a 
piece of very long, ßesh-colored string.
ÒIt would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down 
the stairs,Ó said Ron.
ÒTime is Galleons, little brother,Ó said Fred. Ò
Anyway, Harry, youÕre 
interfering with reception. 
Extendable 
Ears,Ó he added in response to 


HarryÕs raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw 
was trailing out onto the landing. ÒWeÕre trying to hear whatÕs going 
on downstairs.Ó
ÒYou want to be careful,Ó said Ron, staring at the ear. ÒIf Mum sees 
one of them again...Ó
ÒItÕs worth the risk, thatÕs a major meeting theyÕre having,Ó said 
Fred.
!
e door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
ÒOh hello, Harry!Ó said RonÕs younger sister, Ginny, brightly. ÒI 
thought I heard your voice.Ó
Turning to Fred and George she said, ÒItÕs no go with the 
Extend-
able 
Ears, sheÕs gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen 
door.Ó
ÒHow dÕyou know?Ó said George, looking crestfallen.
ÒTonks told me how to Þnd out,Ó said Ginny. ÒYou just chuck stu
#
 at the door and if it canÕt make contact the doorÕs been Imperturbed. 
IÕve been ßicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they 
just soar away from it, so thereÕs no way the 
Extendable 
Ears will be 
able to get under the gap.Ó
Fred heaved a deep sigh. ÒShame. I really fancied Þnding out what 
old SnapeÕs been up to.Ó
ÒSnape?Ó said Harry quickly. ÒIs he here?Ó
ÒYeah,Ó said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down 
on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. ÒGiving a report. Top 
secret.Ó
ÒGit,Ó said Fred idly.
ÒHeÕs on our side now,Ó said Her
 mi one reprovingly.
Ron snorted. ÒDoesnÕt stop him being a git. 
!
e way he looks at us 
when he sees us....Ó
ÒBill doesnÕt like him either,Ó said Ginny, as though that settled the 
matter.

Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for 
 information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank 
onto the bed opposite the others.
ÒIs Bill here?Ó he asked. ÒI thought he was working in 
Egypt.Ó
ÒHe applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for 
the Order,Ó said Fred. ÒHe says he misses the tombs, but,Ó he smirked, 
Òthere are compensations....Ó
ÒWhat dÕyou mean?Ó
ÒRemember old Fleur Delacour?Ó said George. ÒSheÕs got a job at 
Gringotts to 
eemprove Õer Eeenglish 
ÑÓÒÑand BillÕs been giving her a lot of private lessons,Ó sniggered 
Fred.
ÒCharlieÕs in the Order too,Ó said George, Òbut heÕs still in 
 Romania, 
Dum
 ble
 dore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so 
CharlieÕs trying to make contacts on his days o
#
.Ó
ÒCouldnÕt Percy do that?Ó Harry asked. 
!
e last he had heard, the 
third Weasley brother was working in the Department of Interna-
tional Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.
At these words all the Weasleys and Her
 mi one exchanged darkly 
signiÞcant looks.
ÒWhatever you do, donÕt mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,Ó 
Ron told Harry in a tense voice.
ÒWhy not?Ó
ÒBecause every time PercyÕs nameÕs mentioned, Dad breaks what-
ever heÕs holding and Mum starts crying,Ó Fred said.
ÒItÕs been awful,Ó said Ginny sadly.
ÒI think weÕre well shut of him,Ó said George with an uncharacter-
istically ugly look on his face.
ÒWhatÕs happened?Ó Harry said.
ÒPercy and Dad had a row,Ó said Fred. ÒIÕve never seen Dad row 
with anyone like that. ItÕs normally Mum who shouts....Ó
ÒIt was the Þrst week back after term ended,Ó said Ron. ÒWe were 


about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us heÕd 
been promoted.Ó
ÒYouÕre kidding?Ó said Harry.
!
ough he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, 
HarryÕs impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his 
Þrst job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large 
oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by 
Lord Vol
 de mort (not that the Ministry had believed thatÑthey all 
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).
ÒYeah, we were all surprised,Ó said George, Òbecause Percy got into 
a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. 
!
ey said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was o
# his rocker and 
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, 
he wasnÕt going to complain....Ó
ÒSo how come they promoted him?Ó
Ò
!
atÕs exactly what we wondered,Ó said Ron, who seemed very 
keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped 
yelling. ÒHe came home really pleased with himselfÑeven more 
pleased than usual if you can imagine thatÑand told Dad heÕd been 
o
#
ered a position in FudgeÕs own o
"
ce. 
A really good one for some-
one only a year out of HogwartsÑJunior 
Assistant to the Minister. 
He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.Ó
ÒOnly Dad wasnÕt,Ó said Fred grimly.
ÒWhy not?Ó said Harry.
ÒWell, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry 
checking that nobodyÕs having any contact with Dum
 ble
 dore,Ó said 
George.
ÒDum
 ble
 doreÕs nameÕs mud with the Ministry these days, see,Ó 
said Fred. Ò
!
ey all think heÕs just making trouble saying You-Know-
WhoÕs back.Ó
ÒDad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone whoÕs in league with 
Dum
 ble
 dore can clear out their desks,Ó said George.

ÒTrouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows heÕs friendly with Dum
-ble
 dore, and heÕs always thought DadÕs a bit of a weirdo because of his 
Muggle obsessionÑÓ
ÒBut whatÕs this got to do with Percy?Ó asked Harry, confused.
ÒIÕm coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in 
his o
"
ce because he wants to use him to spy on the familyÑand 
 Dum
 ble
 dore.Ó
Harry let out a low whistle.
ÒBet Percy loved that.Ó
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
ÒHe went completely berserk. He saidÑwell, he said loads of ter-
rible stu
#
. He said heÕs been having to struggle against DadÕs lousy 
reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that DadÕs got no 
ambition and thatÕs why weÕve always beenÑyou knowÑnot had a 
lot of money, I meanÑÓ
ÒWhat?Ó 
said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an 
angry cat.
ÒI know,Ó said Ron in a low voice. Ò
And it got worse. He said Dad 
was an idiot to run around with Dum
 ble
 dore, that Dum
 ble
 dore was 
heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and 
that heÑPercyÑknew where his loyalty lay and it was with the 
Ministry. 
And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the 
Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didnÕt belong 
to our family anymore. 
And he packed his bags the same night and 
left. HeÕs living here in London now.Ó
Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of 
RonÕs brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things 
to Mr. Weasley.
ÒMumÕs been in a right state,Ó said Ron. ÒYou knowÑcrying and 
stu
#
. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed 
the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at workÑ
ignores him, I sÕpose.Ó


ÒBut Percy 
must 
know
 Vol
 de mortÕs back,Ó said Harry slowly. ÒHeÕs 
not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldnÕt risk every-
thing without proofÑÓ
ÒYeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,Ó said Ron, shoot-
ing Harry a furtive look. ÒPercy said the only evidence was your word 
and ...
 I dunno ...
 he didnÕt think it was good enough.Ó
ÒPercy takes the 
Daily Prophet
 seriously,Ó said Her
 mi one tartly, and 
the others all nodded.
ÒWhat are you talking about?Ó Harry asked, looking around at 
them all. 
!
ey were all regarding him warily.
ÒHavenÕtÑhavenÕt you been getting the 
Daily Prophet
?Ó Her
 mi-one asked nervously.
ÒYeah, I have!Ó said Harry.
ÒHave youÑerÑbeen reading it thoroughly?Ó Her
 mi one asked 
still more anxiously.
ÒNot cover to cover,Ó said Harry defensively. ÒIf they were go-
ing to report anything about Vol
 de mort it would be headline news, 
wouldnÕt it!Ó
!
e others ßinched at the sound of the name. Her
 mi one hur-
ried on, ÒWell, youÕd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but 
theyÑumÑthey mention you a couple of times a week.Ó
ÒBut IÕd have seenÑÓ
ÒNot if youÕve only been reading the front page, you wouldnÕt,Ó said 
Her
 mi one, shaking her head. ÒIÕm not talking about big articles. 
!
ey 
just slip you in, like youÕre a standing joke.Ó
ÒWhat dÕyouÑ?Ó
ÒItÕs quite nasty, actually,Ó said Her
 mi one in a voice of forced calm. 
Ò
!
eyÕre just building on RitaÕs stu
#
.Ó
ÒBut sheÕs not writing for them anymore, is she?Ó
ÒOh no, sheÕs kept her promiseÑnot that sheÕs got any choice,Ó 
Her
 mi one added with satisfaction. ÒBut she laid the foundation for 
what theyÕre trying to do now.Ó

ÒWhich is 
what
?Ó said Harry impatiently.
ÒOkay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the 
place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?Ó
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita SkeeterÕs sto-
ries about him in a hurry.
ÒWell, theyÕre writing about you as though youÕre this deluded, 
attention-seeking person who thinks heÕs a great tragic hero or some-
thing,Ó said Her
 mi one, very fast, as though it would be less unpleas-
ant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. Ò
!
ey keep slipping in snide 
comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say some-
thing like Ôa tale worthy of Harry PotterÕ and if anyone has a funny 
accident or anything itÕs ÔletÕs hope he hasnÕt got a scar on his forehead 
or weÕll be asked to worship him next ÑÕÓ
ÒI donÕt want anyone to worshipÑÓ Harry began hotly.
ÒI know you donÕt,Ó said Her
 mi one quickly, looking frightened. ÒI 
know, 
Harry. But you see what theyÕre doing? 
!
ey want to turn you 
into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, IÕll bet any-
thing. 
!
ey want wizards on the street to think youÕre just some stu-
pid boy whoÕs a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because 
he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.Ó
ÒI didnÕt askÑI didnÕt wantÑ
Vol
 de mort killed my parents!
Ó Harry spluttered. ÒI got famous because he murdered my family but 
couldnÕt kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? DonÕt they think 
IÕd rather itÕd neverÑÓ
ÒWe 
know,
 Harry,Ó said Ginny earnestly.
ÒAnd of course, they didnÕt report a word about the dementors 
attacking you,Ó said Her
 mi one. ÒSomeoneÕs told them to keep that 
quiet. 
!
at shouldÕve been a really big story, out-of-control demen-
tors. 
!
ey havenÕt even reported that you broke the International 
Statute of SecrecyÑwe thought they would, it would tie in so well 
with this image of you as some stupid show-o
#
Ñwe think theyÕre 


 biding their time until youÕre expelled, then theyÕre really going to go 
to townÑI mean, 
if youÕre expelled, obviously,Ó she went on hastily, 
Òyou really shouldnÕt be, not if they abide by their own laws, thereÕs 
no case against you.Ó
!
ey were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think 
about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved 
the necessity of Þnding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the 
stairs.
ÒUh-oh.Ó
Fred gave the 
Extendable 
Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud 
crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley ap-
peared in the bedroom doorway.
Ò
!
e meetingÕs over, you can come down and have dinner now, 
 everyoneÕs dying to see you, Harry. 
And whoÕs left all those Dung-
bombs outside the kitchen door?Ó
ÒCrookshanks,Ó said Ginny unblushingly. ÒHe loves playing with 
them.Ó
ÒOh,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, ÒI thought it might have been Kreacher, 
he keeps doing odd things like that. Now donÕt forget to keep your 
voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are Þlthy, what have you 
been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please....Ó
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the 
room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Her
 mi one again. Both of 
them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he 
would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. 
!
e sight 
of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.
ÒLook...Ó he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Her
 mi one 
said quietly, ÒWe knew youÕd be angry, Harry, we really donÕt blame 
you, but youÕve got to understand, we 
did 
try and persuade Dum
 ble
-doreÑÓ
ÒYeah, I know,Ó said Harry grudgingly.

He cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dum
 ble
-doreÑthe very thought of him made HarryÕs insides burn with 
 anger again.
ÒWhoÕs Kreacher?Ó he asked.
Ò
!
e house-elf who lives here,Ó said Ron. ÒNutter. Never met one 
like him.Ó
Her
 mi one frowned at Ron.
ÒHeÕs not a 
nutter, 
RonÑÓ
ÒHis lifeÕs ambition is to have his head cut o
# and stuck up on a 
plaque just like his mother,Ó said Ron irritably. ÒIs that normal, Her
-mi one?Ó
ÒWellÑwell, if he is a bit strange, itÕs not his faultÑÓ
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.
ÒHer
 mi one still hasnÕt given up on 
spewÑÓ
ÒItÕs not ÔspewÕ!Ó said Her
 mi one heatedly. ÒItÕs the Society for the 
Promotion of 
ElÞsh Welfare, and itÕs not just me, Dum
 ble
 dore says we 
should be kind to Kreacher tooÑÓ
ÒYeah, yeah,Ó said Ron. ÒCÕmon, IÕm starving.Ó
He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before 
they could descend the stairsÑÒHold it!Ó Ron breathed, ßinging out 
an arm to stop Harry and Her
 mi one walking any farther. Ò
!
eyÕre 
still in the hall, we might be able to hear somethingÑÓ
!
e three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. 
!
e gloomy 
hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of 
HarryÕs guard. 
!
ey were whispering excitedly together. In the very 
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and promi
-nent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. 
Harry leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what 
Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. ...
 A thin piece of ßesh-colored string descended in front of HarryÕs 
eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cau-
tiously lowering the 
Extendable 
Ear toward the dark knot of people 


below. 
A moment later, however, they began to move toward the front 
door and out of sight.
ÒDammit,Ó Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the 
Extendable 
Ear back up again.
!
ey heard the front door open and then close.
ÒSnape never eats here,Ó Ron told Harry quietly. Ò
!
ank God. 
CÕmon.Ó
ÒAnd donÕt forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,Ó Her
-mi one whispered.
As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw Lu-
pin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its 
many locks and bolts behind those who had just left.
ÒWeÕre eating down in the kitchen,Ó Mrs. Weasley whispered, meet-
ing them at the bottom of the stairs. ÒHarry, dear, if youÕll just tiptoe 
across the hall, itÕs through this door hereÑÓ
CRASH.
ÒTonks!Ó 
cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind 
her.
ÒIÕm sorry!Ó wailed Tonks, who was lying ßat on the ßoor. ÒItÕs that 
stupid umbrella stand, thatÕs the second time IÕve tripped overÑÓ
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting, 
bloodcurdling screech.
!
e moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had ßown 
apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry 
thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which 
an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though 
she was being torturedÑthen he realized it was simply a life-size 
portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever 
seen in his life.
!
e old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing 
skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall 
behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that 

Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands 
over his ears.
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the cur-
tains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she 
screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though try-
ing to tear at their faces.
ÒFilth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, 
freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my 
fathersÑÓ
Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging 
the huge, heavy trollÕs leg back o
# the ßoor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned 
the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, 
Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. 
!
en a man with long 
black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry.
ÒShut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!Ó he roared, seizing the 
curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned.
!
e old womanÕs face blanched.
ÒYoooou!Ó 
she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. 
ÒBlood traitor, abomination, shame of my ßesh!Ó
ÒI saidÑshutÑUP!Ó roared the man, and with a stupendous ef-
fort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again.
!
e old womanÕs screeches died and an echoing silence fell.
Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, 
HarryÕs godfather, Sirius, turned to face him.
ÒHello, Harry,Ó he said grimly, ÒI see youÕve met my mother.Ó

   t was nearing midnight and th
e Prime Minister was sitting 
alone in his office, reading a 
long memo that was slipping 
through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning be-
hind. He was waiting for a call fr
om the President of a far distant 
country, and between wondering 
when the wretched man would 
telephone, and trying to suppress 
unpleasant memories of what had 
been a very long, tiring, and diffi
cult week, there was not much 
space in his head for anything else
. The more he attempted to focus 
on the print on the page before 
him, the more clearly the Prime 
Minister could see the gloating fa
ce of one of his political oppo-
nents. This particular opponent had 
appeared on the news that very 
day, not only to enumerate all th
e terrible things that had happened 
in the last week (as though anyo
ne needed remindin
g) but also to 
explain why each and every one of them was the governmentÕs fault. 
The Prime MinisterÕs pulse quickened at the very thought of 
these accusations, for they were ne
ither fair nor true. How on earth 
-"!#$%&'("")*'"
 /" was his government supposed to ha
ve stopped that bridge collaps-
ing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not 
spending enough on bridges. The 
bridge was fewer than ten years 
old, and the best experts were 
at a loss to explain why it had 
snapped cleanly in tw
o, sending a dozen ca
rs into the watery 
depths of the river below. And ho
w dare anyone suggest that it was 
lack of policemen that had resu
lted in those two very nasty and 
well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have 
somehow foreseen the freak hurrica
ne in the West
 Country that 
had caused so much damage to bo
th people and property? And was 
it his fault that one of his Junior 
Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had 
chosen this week to act so peculiar
ly that he was now going to be 
spending a lot more time with his family? 
ÒA grim mood has gripped the 
country,Ó the opponent had con-
cluded, barely concealing his own broad grin. 
And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister 
felt it himself; people really did 
seem more miserable than usual. 
Even the weather was dismal; all this
 chilly mist in the middle of 
July. . . . It wasnÕt right,
 it wasnÕt 
normal. . . . 
He turned over the second pa
ge of the memo, saw how much 
longer it went on, and gave it up 
as a bad job. Stretching his arms 
above his head he looked around 
his office mournfully. It was a 
handsome room, with a fine marble 
fireplace facing the long sash 
windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight 
shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, 
looking out at the thin mist that
 was pressing it
self against the 
glass. It was then, as he stood with
 his back to the room, that he 
heard a soft cough behind him. 
He froze, nose to nose with his
 own scared-looking reflection in 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 0" the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He 
turned very slowly to
 face the empty room. 
ÒHello?Ó he said, trying to 
sound braver than he felt. 
For a brief moment he allowed hi
mself the impossible hope that 
nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a 
crisp, decisive voice that sounded 
as though it were reading a pre-
pared statement. It was coming 
Ñ as the Prime Minister had 
known at the first cough Ñ from th
e froglike little man wearing a 
long silver wig who was depicted in 
a small, dirty oil painting in the 
far corner of the room. 
ÒTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly re-
spond immediately. 
Sincerely, Fudge.Ó 
The man in the painting looked in
quiringly at the Prime Minister. 
ÒEr,Ó said the Prime Minister, Òl
isten. . . . ItÕs not a very good 
time for me. . . . IÕm waiting for a 
telephone call, you see . . . from 
the President of ÑÓ 
ÒThat can be rearranged,Ó said 
the portrait at once. The Prime 
MinisterÕs heart sank. He had been afraid of that. 
ÒBut I really was rather
 hoping to speak ÑÓ 
ÒWe shall arrange for the President 
to forget to call. He will tele-
phone tomorrow night instead,Ó said
 the little man. ÒKindly re-
spond immediately to Mr. Fudge.Ó 
ÒI . . . oh . . . very well,Ó said 
the Prime Minister weakly. ÒYes, 
IÕll see Fudge.Ó 
He hurried back to his desk, stra
ightening his tie as he went. He 
had barely resumed his seat, and a
rranged his face into what he 
hoped was a relaxed and unfazed 
expression, when bright green 
flames burst into life in the em
pty grate beneath his marble man-
telpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 1" alarm, as a portly man appeared wi
thin the flames, spinning as fast 
as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine an-
tique rug, brushing ash from the 
sleeves of his long pin-striped 
cloak, a lime-green bo
wler hat in his hand. 
ÒAh . . . Prime Minister,Ó said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward 
with his hand outstretched
. ÒGood to se
e you again.Ó 
The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, 
so said nothing at all. He was no
t remotely pleased to see Fudge, 
whose occasional appe
arances, apart from 
being downright alarm-
ing in themselves, generally meant 
that he was about to hear some 
very bad news. Furthermore, Fudg
e was looking distinctly care-
worn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crum-
pled look. The Prime Minister ha
d seen that kind of look in 
politicians before, and 
it never boded well. 
ÒHow can I help you?Ó he said, sh
aking FudgeÕs hand very briefly 
and gesturing toward the hardest of 
the chairs in front of the desk. 
ÒDifficult to know where to begi
n,Ó muttered Fudge, pulling up 
the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his 
knees. ÒWhat a week, 
what a week . . .Ó 
ÒHad a bad one too, have you?Ó as
ked the Prime Minister stiffly, 
hoping to convey by this that he
 had quite enough on his plate al-
ready without any extra 
helpings from Fudge. 
ÒYes, of course,Ó said Fudge, ru
bbing his eyes wearily and look-
ing morosely at the Prime Minist
er. ÒIÕve been having the same 
week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge . . . the 
Bones and Vance murders . . . not to mention the ruckus in the 
West Country . . .Ó 
ÒYou Ñ er Ñ your Ñ I mean to say, some of your people 
were Ñ were involved in thos
e Ñ those things, were they?Ó 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 2" Fudge fixed the Prime Minister 
with a rather stern look. ÒOf 
course they were,Ó he said. ÒSurely 
youÕve realized whatÕs going on?Ó 
ÒI . . .Ó hesitated 
the Prime Minister. 
It was precisely this sort of 
behavior that ma
de him dislike 
FudgeÕs visits so much. He was, 
after all, the Prime Minister and 
did not appreciate being made to 
feel like an ignorant schoolboy. 
But of course, it had been like this
 from his very first meeting with 
Fudge on his very first evening as
 Prime Minister. He remembered 
it as though it were yesterday 
and knew it would haunt him until 
his dying day. 
He had been standing alone in th
is very office, savoring the tri-
umph that was his after so many 
years of dreaming and scheming, 
when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned 
to find that ugly little portrait 
talking to him, announcing that the 
Minister of Magic wa
s about to arrive an
d introduce himself. 
Naturally, he had thought that th
e long campaign and the strain 
of the election had caused him to
 go mad. He had been utterly ter-
rified to find a portrait talking 
to him, though this had been noth-
ing to how he felt when a self-p
roclaimed wizard had bounced out 
of the fireplace and shaken his 
hand. He had remained speechless 
throughout FudgeÕs kind
ly explanation that there were witches and 
wizards still living in secret all 
over the world and 
his reassurances 
that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of 
Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and 
prevented the non-magical populati
on from getting wind of them. 
It was, said Fudge, a difficult 
job that encompassed everything 
from regulations on responsible 
use of broomsticks to keeping 
the dragon population under cont
rol (the Prime Minister remem-
bered clutching the desk for suppor
t at this point). Fudge had then 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 3" patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fa-
therly sort of way. 
ÒNot to worry,Ó he had said, Òi
tÕs odds-on youÕll never see me 
again. IÕll only bother you if thereÕs something really serious going 
on our end, something thatÕs likely to affect the Muggles Ñ the 
non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, itÕs live and let 
live. And I must say, youÕre taking
 it a lot better than your prede-
cessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax 
planned by the opposition.Ó 
At this, the Prime Minister 
had found his voice at last. 
ÒYouÕre Ñ youÕre 
not a hoax, then?Ó 
It had been his la
st, desperate hope. 
ÒNo,Ó said Fudge gently. ÒNo, IÕm afraid IÕm not. Look.Ó 
And he had turned the Prime Mini
sterÕs teacup into a gerbil. 
ÒBut,Ó said the Prime Minister 
breathlessly, watching his teacup 
chewing on the corner of his next
 speech, Òbut why Ñ why has no-
body told me Ñ ?Ó 
ÒThe Minister of Magic only reve
als him- or herself to the Mug-
gle Prime Minister of the day,Ó sa
id Fudge, poking his wand back 
inside his jacket. ÒWe find it th
e best way to maintain secrecy.Ó 
ÒBut then,Ó bleated the Prime Mi
nister, Òwhy hasnÕt a former 
Prime Minister warned me Ñ ?Ó 
At this, Fudge had actually laughed. 
ÒMy dear Prime Minister, are 
you
 ever going to tell anybody?Ó 
Still chortling, Fudge had thrown 
some powder into the fireplace, 
stepped into the emerald flames
, and vanished 
with a whooshing 
sound. The Prime Minister had sto
od there, quite motionless, and re-
alized that he would never, as long
 as he lived, dare mention this en-
counter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him? 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 4" The shock had taken a little while 
to wear off. For a time, he had 
tried to convince himself that 
Fudge had indeed been a hallucina-
tion brought on by lack of sleep 
during his grueling election cam-
paign. In a vain attempt to rid 
himself of all reminders of this 
uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted 
niece and instructed his private se
cretary to take down the portrait 
of the ugly little man who had a
nnounced FudgeÕs arrival. To the 
Prime MinisterÕs dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossi-
ble to remove. When several carpent
ers, a builder or two, an art 
historian, and the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer had all tried unsuc-
cessfully to prise it from the wa
ll, the Prime Minister had aban-
doned the attempt and simply reso
lved to hope that the thing 
remained motionless and silent for 
the rest of his term in office. 
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his 
eye the occupant of the painting 
yawning, or else scratching his 
nose; even, once or twice, simply 
walking out of his frame and leav-
ing nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. How-
ever, he had trained himself not to
 look at the picture very much, 
and always to tell himself firmly th
at his eyes were playing tricks on 
him when anything like this happened. 
Then, three years ago, on a nigh
t very like tonight, the Prime 
Minister had been alone in his o
ffice when the po
rtrait had once 
again announced the imminent arriva
l of Fudge, who had burst out 
of the fireplace, sopping wet and in
 a state of considerable panic. 
Before the Prime Minister could as
k why he was dripping all over 
the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime 
Minister had never heard of, a man named ÒSeriousÓ Black, some-
thing that sounded like ÒHogwarts,Ó and a boy called Harry Potter, 
none of which made the remotest
 sense to the Prime Minister. 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 5" Ò. . . IÕve just come from Az
kaban,Ó Fudge had 
panted, tipping 
a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his 
pocket. ÒMiddle of the North Sea, 
you know, nasty flight . . . the 
dementors are in uproarÓ Ñ he shuddered Ñ ÒtheyÕve never had 
a breakout before. Anyway, I had to
 come to you, Prime Minister. 
BlackÕs a known Muggle killer and 
may be planning to rejoin You-
Know-Who. . . . But of course
, you donÕt even know who You-
Know-Who is!Ó He had gazed hopele
ssly at the Prime Minister for 
a moment, then said, ÒWell, sit down, sit down, IÕd better fill you 
in. . . . Have a whiskey . . .Ó The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his 
own office, let alone offered his 
own whiskey, but he sat neverthe-
less. Fudge pulled out his wand, conj
ured two large glasses full of 
amber liquid out of thin air, pu
shed one of them into the Prime 
MinisterÕs hand, and 
drew up a chair. 
Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had 
refused to say a certain name alou
d and wrote it instead on a piece 
of parchment, which he had thru
st into the Prime MinisterÕs 
whiskey-free hand. When at last 
Fudge had stood up to leave, the 
Prime Minister ha
d stood up too. 
ÒSo you think that . . .Ó He had 
squinted down at the name in 
his left hand. ÒLord Vol ÑÓ 
ÒHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
!Ó snarled Fudge. 
ÒIÕm sorry. . . . You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is 
still alive, then?Ó 
ÒWell, Dumbledore says he is,Ó said Fudge, as he had fastened 
his pin-striped cloak under his ch
in, Òbut weÕve never found him. 
If you ask me, heÕs not dangerous unless heÕs got support, so itÕs 
Black we ought to be worrying abou
t. YouÕll put out that warning, 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 6" then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don
Õt see each other again, Prime 
Minister! Good night.Ó 
But they had seen each other ag
ain. Less than a year later a 
harassed-looking Fudge had appeared 
out of thin air in the cabinet 
room to inform the Prime Minister
 that there had been a spot of 
bother at the Kwidditch (or that
 was what it had sounded like) 
World Cup and that several Muggle
s had been Òinvolved,Ó but that 
the Prime Minister was not to 
worry, the fact that You-Know-
WhoÕs Mark had been seen again me
ant nothing; Fudge was sure it 
was an isolated incide
nt, and the Muggle Liai
son Office was deal-
ing with all memory modifications as they spoke. 
ÒOh, and I almost forgot,Ó Fudg
e had added. ÒWeÕre importing 
three foreign dragons and a sphinx
 for the Triwizard Tournament, 
quite routine, but the Department
 for the Regulation and Control 
of Magical Creatures tells me that 
itÕs down in the rule book that 
we have to notify you if weÕre br
inging highly da
ngerous creatures 
into the country.Ó 
ÒI Ñ what Ñ 
dragons
?Ó spluttered the Prime Minister. 
ÒYes, three,Ó said Fudge. ÒAnd 
a sphinx. Well, good day to you.Ó 
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and 
sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, 
Fudge had erupted out of the fire ye
t again, this time with the news 
that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban. 
ÒA mass breakout?Ó repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely. 
ÒNo need to worry, no need to worry!Ó shouted Fudge, already 
with one foot in the flames. ÒWeÕ
ll have them rounded up in no 
time Ñ just thought you ought to know!Ó 
And before the Prime Minister co
uld shout, ÒNow, wait just one 
moment!Ó Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks. 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 +7" Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Min-
ister was not a foolish man. It ha
d not escaped his notice that, de-
spite FudgeÕs assurances at their fi
rst meeting, they were now seeing 
rather a lot of each other, nor th
at Fudge was becoming more flus-
tered with each visit. Little though
 he liked to think about the Min-
ister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the 
Other 
Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next 
time Fudge appeared it would be wi
th graver news still. The sight, 
therefore, of Fudge stepping out of
 the fire once more, looking di-
sheveled and fretful and sternly su
rprised that the Prime Minister 
did not know exactly why he was 
there, was about the worst thing 
that had happened in the course 
of this extremely gloomy week. 
ÒHow should I know whatÕs goin
g on in the Ñ er Ñ Wizarding 
community?Ó snapped the Prime Minister now. ÒI have a country 
to run and quite enough concer
ns at the moment without ÑÓ 
ÒWe have the same concerns,Ó 
Fudge interrupted. ÒThe Brock-
dale Bridge didnÕt wear out. That
 wasnÕt really a hurricane. Those 
murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert ChorleyÕs 
family would be safer without 
him. We are currently making 
arrangements to have him transferred to St. MungoÕs Hospital for 
Magical Maladies and Injuries
. The move should be effected 
tonight.Ó 
ÒWhat do you . . . IÕm afraid I . . . 
What?Ó blustered the Prime 
Minister. 
Fudge took a great, deep breath 
and said, ÒPrime Minister, I am 
very sorry to have to tell you th
at heÕs back. He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named is back.Ó 
ÒBack? When you say ÔbackÕ . 
. . heÕs alive? I mean ÑÓ 
The Prime Minister groped in hi
s memory for the details of that 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 ++" horrible conversation of three 
years previously, when Fudge had 
told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wiz-
ard who had committed a thousand 
terrible crimes before his mys-
terious disappearance fi
fteen years earlier. 
ÒYes, alive,Ó said Fudge. ÒThat is Ñ I donÕt know Ñ is a man 
alive if he canÕt be killed? I donÕt really understand it, and Dumble-
dore wonÕt explain properly Ñ but anyway, heÕs certainly got a 
body and is walking and talking an
d killing, so I suppose, for the 
purposes of our discussi
on, yes, heÕs alive.Ó 
The Prime Minister did not know 
what to say to this, but a per-
sistent habit of wishing to appe
ar well-informed on any subject 
that came up made him cast around for any details he could re-
member of their previous conversations. 
ÒIs Serious Black with Ñ er 
Ñ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?Ó 
ÒBlack? Black?Ó said Fudge dist
ractedly, turning his bowler 
rapidly in his fingers. ÒSirius Black, you mean? MerlinÕs beard, no. 
BlackÕs dead. Turns out we were 
Ñ er Ñ mistaken about Black. 
He was innocent after all. And he
 wasnÕt in league with He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean
,Ó he added defensively, spin-
ning the bowler hat still faster, Òa
ll the evidence pointed Ñ we had 
more than fifty eyewitnesses Ñ but anyway, as I say, heÕs dead. 
Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. 
ThereÕs going to be an inquiry, actually. . . .Ó 
To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of 
pity for Fudge at this point. It 
was, however, eclipsed almost im-
mediately by a glow of smugness 
at the thought that, deficient 
though he himself might be in the 
area of materializing out of fire-
places, there had never been a murd
er in any of the government de-
partments under 
his charge. . . . Not 
yet, anyway . . . !#$%&'("")*'"
 +/" While the Prime Minister surrept
itiously touched the wood of 
his desk, Fudge continued, ÒBut 
BlackÕs by-the-by now. The point 
is, weÕre at war, Prime Minist
er, and steps must be taken.Ó 
ÒAt war?Ó repeated the Prime Mini
ster nervously. ÒSurely thatÕs a 
little bit of an overstatement?Ó 
ÒHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those 
of his followers who broke out of 
Azkaban in January,Ó said Fudge, 
speaking more and more rapidly and 
twirling his bowler so fast that 
it was a lime-green blur. ÒSince 
they have moved into the open, 
they have been wreaking havoc. Th
e Brockdale Bridge Ñ he did it, 
Prime Minister, he threatened a 
mass Muggle killing unless I stood 
aside for him and ÑÓ 
ÒGood grief, so itÕs 
your fault those people were killed and IÕm 
having to answer questions abou
t rusted rigging and corroded ex-
pansion joints and I donÕt know wh
at else!Ó said the Prime Minis-
ter furiously. 
ÒMy fault!Ó said Fudge, coloring 
up. ÒAre you saying you would 
have caved in to blackmail like that?Ó 
ÒMaybe not,Ó said the Prime Mini
ster, standing up
 and striding 
about the room, Òbut I would have 
put all my efforts into catching 
the blackmailer before he co
mmitted any such
 atrocity!Ó ÒDo you really think I wasnÕt already making every effort?Ó de-
manded Fudge heatedly. ÒEvery Au
ror in the Ministry was Ñ and 
is Ñ trying to find him and roun
d up his followers, but we happen 
to be talking about one of the most
 powerful wizards of all time, a 
wizard who has eluded captur
e for almost three decades!Ó 
ÒSo I suppose youÕre going to tell me he caused the hurricane in 
the West Country too?Ó said the Prime Minister, his temper rising 
with every pace he took. It was in
furiating to discover the reason 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 +0" for all these terrible disasters and no
t to be able to tell the public, 
almost worse than it being the governmentÕs fault after all. 
ÒThat was no hurricane,Ó said Fudge miserably. 
ÒExcuse me!Ó barked the Prime 
Minister, now positively stamp-
ing up and down. ÒTrees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts 
bent, horrible injuries ÑÓ 
ÒIt was the Death Eaters,Ó said
 Fudge. ÒHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-
NamedÕs followers. An
d . . . and we suspect giant involvement.Ó 
The Prime Minister stopped in hi
s tracks as though he had hit 
an invisible wall. Ò
What involvement?Ó 
Fudge grimaced. ÒHe used giants 
last time, when he wanted to 
go for the grand effect,Ó he said. ÒThe Office of Misinformation 
has been working around the clock,
 weÕve had teams of Obliviators 
out trying to modify the memori
es of all the 
Muggles who saw 
what really happened, weÕve got mo
st of the Department for the 
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around 
Somerset, but we canÕt find the 
giant Ñ itÕs been a disaster.Ó 
ÒYou donÕt say!Ó sa
id the Prime Minister furiously. 
ÒI wonÕt deny that morale is pr
etty low at the Ministry,Ó said 
Fudge. ÒWhat with al
l that, and then losi
ng Amelia Bones.Ó 
ÒLosing who?Ó 
ÒAmelia Bones. Head of the De
partment of Magical Law En-
forcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have 
murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and Ñ 
and all the evidence was that
 she put up a real fight.Ó 
Fudge cleared his throat and, wi
th an effort, it seemed, stopped 
spinning his bowler hat. 
ÒBut that murder wa
s in the newspapers,Ó 
said the Prime Minis-
ter, momentarily diverted from his anger. Ò
Our newspapers. Amelia 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 +1" Bones . . . it just said she wa
s a middle-aged woman who lived 
alone. It was a Ñ a nasty killing, wa
snÕt it? ItÕs had rather a lot of 
publicity. The police are baffled, you see.Ó 
Fudge sighed. ÒWell, of course th
ey are,Ó he said. ÒKilled in a 
room that was locked from the insi
de, wasnÕt she? We, on the other 
hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further to-
ward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe 
you didnÕt hear ab
out that one ÑÓ 
ÒOh yes I did!Ó said the Prime Minister. ÒIt happened just 
around the corner from here, as a 
matter of fact. The papers had a 
field day with it, Ôbreakdown of 
law and order in the Prime Minis-
terÕs backyard ÑÕÓ 
ÒAnd as if all that wasnÕt enough,
Ó said Fudge, barely listening to 
the Prime Minister, ÒweÕve got de
mentors swarming all over the 
place, attacking people left
, right, and center. . . .Ó 
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unin-
telligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now. 
ÒI thought dementors guard the pr
isoners in Azkaban,Ó he said 
cautiously. 
ÒThey did,Ó said Fudge wearily. ÒBut not anymore. TheyÕve 
deserted the prison and joined
 He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I 
wonÕt pretend that wasnÕt a blow.Ó 
ÒBut,Ó said the Prime Minister, 
with a sense of dawning horror, 
ÒdidnÕt you tell me theyÕre the cr
eatures that drai
n hope and happi-
ness out of people?Ó 
ÒThatÕs right. And theyÕre breeding
. ThatÕs whatÕs causing all this 
mist.Ó 
The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. 
The idea of invisible creature
s swooping through the towns and 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 +2" countryside, spreading despair and 
hopelessness in his voters, made 
him feel quite faint. 
ÒNow see here, Fudge Ñ youÕve go
t to do something! ItÕs your 
responsibility as Minister of Magic!Ó 
ÒMy dear Prime Minister, you ca
nÕt honestly think IÕm still Min-
ister of Magic after all this? I was 
sacked three days ago! The whole 
Wizarding community has been scre
aming for my resignation for a 
fortnight. IÕve never known them 
so united in my whole term of 
office!Ó said Fudge, with 
a brave attempt at a smile. 
The Prime Minister was momentaril
y lost for words. Despite his 
indignation at the position into 
which he had been placed, he still 
rather felt for the shrunken-loo
king man sitting opposite him. 
ÒIÕm very sorry,Ó he said finally.
 ÒIf thereÕs anyt
hing I can do?Ó 
ÒItÕs very kind of you, Prime Mini
ster, but there is nothing. I was 
sent here tonight to bring you up to
 date on recent events and to in-
troduce you to my successor. I rather
 thought heÕd be here by now, 
but of course, heÕs very busy at th
e moment, with so much going on.Ó 
Fudge looked around at the portra
it of the ugly little man wear-
ing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the 
point of a quill. Catching FudgeÕs 
eye, the portrait said, ÒHeÕll be 
here in a moment, heÕs just fini
shing a letter to Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒI wish him luck,Ó said Fudge, 
sounding bitter for the first time. 
ÒIÕve been writing to 
Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, 
but he wonÕt budge. If heÕd just 
been prepared to persuade the boy, 
I might still be . . . Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.Ó 
Fudge subsided into what was clea
rly an aggrieved silence, but it 
was broken almost immediately 
by the portrait, which suddenly 
spoke in its crisp, official voice. 
ÒTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 +3" Urgent. Kindly respond immediatel
y. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister 
of Magic.Ó ÒYes, yes, fine,Ó said the Prime 
Minister distractedly, and he 
barely flinched as the flames in
 the grate turned emerald green 
again, rose up, and revealed a se
cond spinning wizard in their 
heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug. 
Fudge got to his feet and, after 
a momentÕs hesitation, the Prime 
Minister did the same, watching th
e new arrival straighten up, dust 
down his long black robes, and look around. 
The Prime MinisterÕs first, foolish thought was that Rufus 
Scrimgeour looked rather like an
 old lion. There 
were streaks of 
gray in his mane of tawny hair
 and his bushy eyebrows; he had 
keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a 
certain rangy, loping grace even th
ough he walked with a slight 
limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and 
toughness; the Prime Minister 
thought he understood why the 
Wizarding community preferred Scri
mgeour to Fudge as a leader 
in these dangerous times. 
ÒHow do you do?Ó said the Prime 
Minister politely, holding out 
his hand. 
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, 
his eyes scanning the room, then 
pulled out a wand from under his robes. 
ÒFudge told you everything?Ó he as
ked, striding over to the door 
and tapping the keyhole with his 
wand. The Prime Minister heard 
the lock click. 
ÒEr Ñ yes,Ó said the Prime Minister. ÒAnd if you donÕt mind, IÕd 
rather that door re
mained unlocked.Ó 
ÒIÕd rather not be interrupted
,Ó said Scrimgeour shortly, Òor 
watched,Ó he added, pointing his wa
nd at the windows, so that the 
&#'"")&#'("",-*-.&'("
 +4" curtains swept across 
them. ÒRight, well, IÕm 
a busy man, so letÕs 
get down to business. First of all, we
 need to discuss your security.Ó 
The Prime Minister drew himself 
up to his fullest height and 
replied, ÒI am perfectl
y happy with the security IÕve already got, 
thank you very ÑÓ 
ÒWell, weÕre not,Ó Scrimgeour cut in. ÒItÕll be a poor lookout for 
the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius 
Curse. The new secretary in
 your outer office ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if thatÕs what youÕre 
suggesting!Ó said the Prime Minister hotly. ÒHeÕs highly efficient, 
gets through twice the work the rest of them ÑÓ 
ÒThatÕs because heÕs a wizard,Ó sa
id Scrimgeour, without a flicker 
of a smile. ÒA highly trained Auro
r, who has been assigned to you 
for your protection.Ó 
ÒNow, wait a moment!Ó declared 
the Prime Minister. ÒYou canÕt 
just put your people into my offi
ce, I decide who 
works for me ÑÓ 
ÒI thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?Ó said Scrimgeour 
coldly. 
ÒI am Ñ thatÕs to say, I was ÑÓ 
ÒThen thereÕs no problem, is there?Ó said Scrimgeour. 
ÒI . . . well, as long as Shacklebol
tÕs work continues 
to be . . . er 
. . . excellent,Ó said the Prime 
Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour 
barely seemed to hear him. 
ÒNow, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,Ó he contin-
ued. ÒThe one who has been entertaining the public by imperson-
ating a duck.Ó 
ÒWhat about him?Ó aske
d the Prime Minister. 
ÒHe has clearly reacted to a poorly
 performed Imperi
us Curse,Ó said 
Scrimgeour. ÒItÕs addled his brains, 
but he could still be dangerous.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*'"
 +5" ÒHeÕs only quacking!Ó said the 
Prime Minister weakly. ÒSurely a 
bit of a rest . . . Maybe go
 easy on the drink . . .Ó 
ÒA team of Healers from St. MungoÕs Hospital for Magical Mal-
adies and Injuries are examining him 
as we speak. So far he has at-
tempted to strangle three of them
,Ó said Scrimgeour. ÒI think it 
best that we remove him from
 Muggle society for a while.Ó 
ÒI . . . well . . . HeÕll be all right, wonÕt he?Ó said the Prime Min-
ister anxiously. 
Scrimgeour merely shrugged, al
ready moving back toward the 
fireplace. ÒWell, thatÕs really all I had to 
say. I will keep you posted of de-
velopments, Prime Minister Ñ or, at
 least, I shall probably be too 
busy to come personally, in which 
case I shall send Fudge here. He 
has consented to stay on 
in an advisory capacity.Ó 
Fudge attempted to smile, bu
t was unsuccessful; he merely 
looked as though he had a tootha
che. Scrimgeour was already rum-
maging in his pocket for the myster
ious powder that turned the fire 
green. The Prime Minister gazed hope
lessly at the pair of them for 
a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening 
burst from him at last. 
ÒBut for heavenÕs sake Ñ youÕre 
wizards! You can do 
magic! Surely you can sort out Ñ well Ñ 
anything!Ó Scrimgeour turned slowly on th
e spot and exchanged an incred-
ulous look with Fudge, who really 
did manage a smile this time as 
he said kindly, ÒThe trouble is, 
the other side can do magic too, 
Prime Minister.Ó 
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into 
the bright green fi
re and vanished.

   any miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against 
the Prime MinisterÕs windows drifted over a dirty 
river that wound between overgrow
n, rubbish-strewn banks. An 
immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and 
ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black 
water and no sign of life apart fr
om a scrawny fox that had slunk 
down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrap-
pings in the tall grass. 
But then, with a very faint 
pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared 
out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes 
fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to 
take its bearings for a few moments,
 then set off with light, quick 
strides, its long cloak ru
stling over the grass. 
With a second and louder 
pop, another hooded figure materi-
alized. ÒWait!Ó 
2"!#$%&'(""&)*"
 34" The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the 
undergrowth. It leapt from its hid
ing place and up the bank. There 
was a flash of green light, a yelp
, and the fox fell back to the 
ground, dead. 
The second figure turned over
 the animal with its toe. 
ÒJust a fox,Ó said a womanÕs voic
e dismissively from under the 
hood. ÒI thought perhaps an
 Auror Ñ Cissy, wait!Ó 
But her quarry, who had paused an
d looked back at the flash of 
light, was already scrambling up 
the bank the fox had just fallen 
down. ÒCissy Ñ Narcissa Ñ listen to me ÑÓ 
The second woman caught the firs
t and seized her arm, but the 
other wrenched it away. 
ÒGo back, Bella!Ó 
ÒYou must listen to me!Ó 
ÒIÕve listened already. IÕve made my decision. Leave me alone!Ó 
The woman named Narcissa gained
 the top of the bank, where 
a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled 
street. The other woman, Bella, foll
owed at once. Side by side they 
stood looking across the road at th
e rows and rows of dilapidated 
brick houses, their wi
ndows dull and blin
d in the darkness. 
ÒHe lives here?Ó asked Bella 
in a voice of contempt. Ò
Here
? In 
this Muggle dunghill? We must be 
the first of our kind ever to set 
foot ÑÓ 
But Narcissa was not listening; sh
e had slipped through a gap in 
the rusty railings and was al
ready hurrying across the road. 
ÒCissy, 
wait!Ó Bella followed, her cloak stream
ing behind, and saw Narcissa 
darting through an alley between th
e houses into a second, almost 
-%.//'(0-""'/1"
 3+" identical street. Some of the st
reetlamps were broken; the two 
women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. 
The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another 
corner, this time succeeding in ca
tching hold of her arm and swing-
ing her around so that they faced each other. 
ÒCissy, you must not do th
is, you canÕt trust him ÑÓ 
ÒThe Dark Lord trusts him, doesnÕt he?Ó 
ÒThe Dark Lord is . . . I believ
e . . . mistaken,Ó
 Bella panted, 
and her eyes gleamed momentaril
y under her hood as she looked 
around to check that they were in
deed alone. ÒIn any case, we were 
told not to speak of the plan to 
anyone. This is a betrayal of the 
Dark LordÕs ÑÓ 
ÒLet go, Bella!Ó snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from be-
neath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the otherÕs face. Bella 
merely laughed. 
ÒCissy, your own sister? You wouldnÕt ÑÓ 
ÒThere is nothing I wouldnÕt do anymore!Ó Narcissa breathed, a 
note of hysteria in 
her voice, and as she brought down the wand 
like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sis-
terÕs arm as though burned. 
ÒNarcissa!Ó But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer 
followed again, keeping her distan
ce now, as they moved deeper 
into the deserted labyrinth of br
ick houses. At last, Narcissa hur-
ried up a street named SpinnerÕs En
d, over which the towering mill 
chimney seemed to hover like a 
giant admonitory finger. Her foot-
steps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken win-
dows, until she reached the very 
last house, where a dim light 
glimmered through the curtai
ns in a downstairs room. 
!#$%&'(""&)*"
 33" She had knocked on the door befo
re Bella, cursing under her 
breath, had caught up. Together
 they stood waiting, panting 
slightly, breathing in the smell of 
the dirty river that was carried to 
them on the night breeze. After 
a few seconds, they heard move-
ment behind the door and it opened
 a crack. A sliver of a man 
could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair 
parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes. 
Narcissa threw back he
r hood. She was so pa
le that she seemed 
to shine in the darkness; the long
 blonde hair streaming down her 
back gave her the look
 of a drowned person. 
ÒNarcissa!Ó said the man, opening 
the door a little wider, so that 
the light fell upon her and her si
ster too. ÒWhat a pleasant sur-
prise! ÒSeverus,Ó she said in a strained
 whisper. ÒMay I speak to you? 
ItÕs urgent.Ó 
ÒBut of course.Ó 
He stood back to allow her to pass
 him into the house. Her still-
hooded sister followed
 without invitation. 
ÒSnape,Ó she said curtly as she passed him. 
ÒBellatrix,Ó he replied, his thin
 mouth curling into a slightly 
mocking smile as he closed the 
door with a sn
ap behind them. 
They had stepped 
directly into a tiny 
sitting room, which had 
the feeling of a dark, padded cell. 
The walls were completely cov-
ered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; 
a threadbare sofa, an old armc
hair, and a rickety table stood 
grouped together in a pool of dim 
light cast by a candle-filled lamp 
hung from the ceiling. The place ha
d an air of neglect, as though it 
was not usually inhabited. 
Snape gestured Narcissa to the so
fa. She threw off her cloak, cast 
-%.//'(0-""'/1"
 35" it aside, and sat down, staring 
at her white and trembling hands 
clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowe
red her hood more slowly. Dark as 
her sister was fair, with heavily lidd
ed eyes and a strong jaw, she did 
not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind 
Narcissa. 
ÒSo, what can I do for you?Ó Snape 
asked, settling himself in the 
armchair opposite the two sisters. 
ÒWe . . . we are alone, arenÕt 
we?Ó Narcissa asked quietly. 
ÒYes, of course. Well, WormtailÕs
 here, but weÕre not counting 
vermin, are we?Ó 
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with 
a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon 
which a small man stood frozen. 
ÒAs you have clearly realized, Wo
rmtail, we have guests,Ó said 
Snape lazily. 
The man crept, hunchbacked, 
down the last few steps and 
moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, 
and wore an unpleasant simper. 
His left hand was caressing his 
right, which looked as though it
 was encased in 
a bright silver 
glove. 
ÒNarcissa!Ó he said, in a sque
aky voice. ÒAnd
 Bellatrix! How 
charming ÑÓ 
ÒWormtail will get us drinks, if youÕd like them,Ó said Snape. 
ÒAnd then he will return to his bedroom.Ó 
Wormtail winced as though Sn
ape had thrown something at 
him. ÒI am not your servant!Ó he sq
ueaked, avoiding SnapeÕs eye. 
ÒReally? I was under the impression
 that the Dark Lord placed 
you here to assist me.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)*"
 36" ÒTo assist, yes Ñ but not to ma
ke you drinks and Ñ and clean 
your house!Ó 
ÒI had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous 
assignments,Ó said Snape silkily. ÒThis can be easily arranged: I 
shall speak to the Dark Lord ÑÓ 
ÒI can speak to him my
self if I want to!Ó 
ÒOf course you can,Ó said Snape,
 sneering. ÒBut in the mean-
time, bring us drinks. Some of
 the elf-made wine will do.Ó 
Wormtail hesitated for a moment
, looking as though he might 
argue, but then turned and head
ed through a se
cond hidden door. 
They heard banging and a clinking 
of glasses. Within seconds he 
was back, bearing a dusty bottle an
d three glasses upon a tray. He 
dropped these on the rickety tabl
e and scurried from their pres-
ence, slamming the book-c
overed door behind him. 
Snape poured out thre
e glasses of bloodred wine and handed 
two of them to the sisters. Narc
issa murmured a word of thanks, 
whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. 
This did not seem to discompose 
him; on the contrary, he looked 
rather amused. 
ÒThe Dark Lord,Ó he said, rais
ing his glass an
d draining it. 
The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa 
took her second drink she said in a rush, ÒSeverus, IÕm sorry to 
come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only 
one who can help me ÑÓ 
Snape held up a hand to stop he
r, then pointed 
his wand again 
at the concealed stairc
ase door. There was a loud
 bang and a squeal, 
followed by the sound of Wormtail
 scurrying back up the stairs. ÒMy apologies,Ó said Snape. ÒHe has lately taken to listening at  
 -%.//'(0-""'/1"
 37" doors, I donÕt know what he mean
s by it. . . . You were saying, 
Narcissa?Ó 
She took a great, shuddering
 breath and started again. 
ÒSeverus, I know I ought not to be
 here, I have been told to say 
nothing to anyone, but ÑÓ 
ÒThen you ought to hold your tongue!Ó snarled Bellatrix. ÒPar-
ticularly in present company!Ó 
ÒÔPresent companyÕ?Ó repeated 
Snape sardonically. ÒAnd what 
am I to understand 
by that, Bellatrix?Ó 
ÒThat I donÕt trust you, Snape, as you very well know!Ó 
Narcissa let out a noise that mi
ght have been a dry sob and cov-
ered her face with her hands. 
Snape set his glass down upon the 
table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smil-
ing into BellatrixÕs glowering face. 
ÒNarcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to 
say; it will save tedious interru
ptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,Ó 
said Snape. ÒWhy is it 
that you do not trust me?Ó ÒA hundred reasons!Ó she said lo
udly, striding out from behind 
the sofa to slam her glass upon th
e table. ÒWhere to start! Where 
were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any 
attempt to find him 
when he vanished? What
 have you been doing 
all these years that youÕve live
d in DumbledoreÕs pocket? Why did 
you stop the Dark Lord procur
ing the SorcererÕs Stone? Why 
did you not return at once when 
the Dark Lord was reborn? Where 
were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy 
for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape,
 is Harry Potter still alive, 
when you have had him at yo
ur mercy for five years?Ó 
She paused, her chest risi
ng and falling rapidly, the color high in  
 !#$%&'(""&)*"
 38" her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa 
sat motionless, her face still hid-
den in her hands. 
Snape smiled. 
ÒBefore I answer you Ñ oh yes, Be
llatrix, I am going to answer! 
You can carry my words back to 
the others who whisper behind my 
back, and carry false tales of my tr
eachery to the Dark Lord! Before 
I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really 
think that the Dark Lord has not 
asked me each and every one of 
those questions? And do you really
 think that, had I not been able 
to give satisfactory answers, I woul
d be sitting here talking to you?Ó 
She hesitated. 
ÒI know he believes you, but . . .Ó 
ÒYou think he is mistaken? Or 
that I have somehow hoodwinked 
him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accom-
plished Legilimens the world has ever seen?Ó 
Bellatrix said nothing, but looked
, for the first time, a little dis-
comfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink 
again, sipped it, and continued,
 ÒYou ask where I was when the 
Dark Lord fell. I was where he ha
d ordered me to be, at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy 
upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, 
I presume, that it was on the 
Dark LordÕs orders that
 I took up the post?Ó 
She nodded almost imperceptibl
y and then opened her mouth, 
but Snape forestalled her. 
ÒYou ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. 
For the same reason that Avery, 
Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lu-
ciusÓ Ñ he inclined his head slig
htly to Narcissa Ñ Òand many 
others did not attempt to find hi
m. I believed him finished. I am 
not proud of it, I was wrong, but 
there it is. . . . If he had not 
-%.//'(0-""'/1"
 39" forgiven we who lost faith at that
 time, he would have very few fol-
lowers left.Ó 
ÒHeÕd have me!Ó said Bellatrix 
passionately. ÒI, 
who spent many 
years in Azkaban for him!Ó 
ÒYes, indeed, most admirable,Ó sa
id Snape in a bored voice. ÒOf 
course, you werenÕt a lot of use to
 him in prison, but the gesture 
was undoubtedly
 fine ÑÓ 
ÒGesture!Ó she shrieked; in her 
fury she looked slightly mad. 
ÒWhile I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, com-
fortably playing DumbledoreÕs pet!Ó 
ÒNot quite,Ó said Snape calmly. 
ÒHe wouldnÕt give me the De-
fense Against the Dark Arts job, 
you know. Seemed to think it 
might, ah, bring about a relapse . 
. . tempt me into my old ways.Ó 
ÒThis was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your fa-
vorite subject?Ó she jeered. ÒWhy 
did you stay there all that time, 
Snape? Still spying on Dumble
dore for a master you believed 
dead?Ó ÒHardly,Ó said Snape, Òalthough the Dark Lord is pleased that I 
never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on 
Dumbledore to give him when he 
returned, a rather more useful 
welcome-back present than endles
s reminiscences of how unpleas-
ant Azkaban is. . . .Ó 
ÒBut you stayed ÑÓ 
ÒYes, Bellatrix, I stayed,Ó said 
Snape, betraying a hint of impa-
tience for the first time. ÒI had a comfortable job that I preferred to 
a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you 
know. DumbledoreÕs protection kept
 me out of jail; it was most 
convenient and I used it. I repe
at: The Dark Lord does not com-
plain that I stayed, so 
I do not see 
why you do. 
!#$%&'(""&)*"
 3:" ÒI think you next wanted to know,Ó he pressed on, a little more 
loudly, for Bellatrix showed ever
y sign of interr
upting, Òwhy I 
stood between the Dark Lord and the 
SorcererÕs Stone. That is eas-
ily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He 
thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to 
DumbledoreÕs stooge. He was in a 
pitiable condition, very weak, 
sharing the body of a mediocre wi
zard. He did not dare reveal him-
self to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore 
or the Ministry. I deeply regret th
at he did not trust me. He would 
have returned to power three year
s sooner. As it was, I saw only 
greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I 
admit, I did all I could to thwart him.Ó 
BellatrixÕs mouth twisted as thou
gh she had taken an unpleasant 
dose of medicine. 
ÒBut you didnÕt return when he ca
me back, you didnÕt fly back to 
him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn ÑÓ 
ÒCorrect. I returned two hours 
later. I returned on Dumble-
doreÕs orders.Ó ÒOn DumbledoreÕs Ñ ?Ó she be
gan, in tones of outrage. 
ÒThink!Ó said Snape, impatient 
again. ÒThink! By waiting two 
hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a 
spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning 
to the Dark LordÕs side because I 
was ordered to, I 
have been able 
to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix 
ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: 
The Dark Mark ha
d been growing 
stronger for months. I knew he must
 be about to return, all the Death 
Eaters knew! I had plenty of time 
to think about what I wanted to 
do, to plan my next move, to es
cape like Karkaroff, didnÕt I? 
ÒThe Dark LordÕs initial disple
asure at my lateness vanished 
-%.//'(0-""'/1"
 3," entirely, I assure you, when I explai
ned that I remained faithful, al-
though Dumbledore thought I was 
his man. Yes, the Dark Lord 
thought that I had left him 
forever, but he was wrong.Ó 
ÒBut what use have you been?Ó 
sneered Bellatrix. ÒWhat useful 
information have we had from you?Ó 
ÒMy information has been conveyed
 directly to the Dark Lord,Ó 
said Snape. ÒIf he chooses no
t to share it with you ÑÓ 
ÒHe shares everything with me!Ó said
 Bellatrix, firi
ng up at once. 
ÒHe calls me his most loya
l, his most faithful ÑÓ 
ÒDoes he?Ó said Snape, his voice 
delicately inflected to suggest 
his disbelief. ÒDoes he 
still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?Ó 
ÒThat was not my fault!Ó said Be
llatrix, flushing. ÒThe Dark 
Lord has, in the past, entrusted 
me with his most precious Ñ if 
Lucius hadnÕt ÑÓ 
ÒDonÕt you dare Ñ donÕt you 
dare blame my husband!Ó said 
Narcissa, in a low and deadly vo
ice, looking up at her sister. 
ÒThere is no point apportioning
 blame,Ó said Snape smoothly. 
ÒWhat is done, is done.Ó 
ÒBut not by you!Ó said Bellatrix 
furiously. ÒNo, you were once 
again absent while the re
st of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?Ó 
ÒMy orders were to remain behi
nd,Ó said Snape. ÒPerhaps you 
disagree with the Dark Lord, pe
rhaps you think that Dumbledore 
would not have noticed if I had joi
ned forces with the Death Eaters 
to fight the Order of the Phoeni
x? And Ñ forgive me Ñ you speak 
of dangers . . . you were facing
 six teenagers, were you not?Ó 
ÒThey were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order 
before long!Ó snarled Bellatrix. ÒAnd, while we are on the subject of 
the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts 
of their headquar
ters, donÕt you?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)*"
 54" ÒI am not the Secret-Keeper; I 
cannot speak the name of the 
place. You understand how the en
chantment works, I think? The 
Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on 
the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture 
and murder of Emmeline Vance, and 
it certainly helped dispose of 
Sirius Black, though I 
give you full credit for finishing him off.Ó 
He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not 
soften. 
ÒYou are avoiding my last qu
estion, Snape. Harry Potter. You 
could have killed him at any point 
in the past five years. You have 
not done it. Why?Ó 
ÒHave you discussed this matter
 with the Dark Lord?Ó asked 
Snape. ÒHe . . . lately, we . . . I am asking you, Snape!Ó 
ÒIf I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have 
used his blood to regenerate
, making him invincible ÑÓ 
ÒYou claim you foresaw his us
e of the boy!Ó she jeered. 
ÒI do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already con-
fessed that I thought the Dark Lord 
dead. I am merely trying to ex-
plain why the Dark Lord is not so
rry that Potter survived, at least 
until a year ago. . . .Ó 
ÒBut why did you keep him alive?Ó 
ÒHave you not understood me? It was only DumbledoreÕs pro-
tection that was keepin
g me out of Azkaban! 
Do you disagree that 
murdering his favorite student mi
ght have turned him against me? 
But there was more to it than that
. I should remind you that when 
Potter first arrived at Hogwarts th
ere were still many stories circu-
lating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, 
which was how he had survived th
e Dark LordÕs attack. Indeed, 
-%.//'(0-""'/1"
 5+" many of the Dark LordÕs old foll
owers thought Potter might be a 
standard around which we could a
ll rally once more. I was curious, 
I admit it, and not at all inclined 
to murder him th
e moment he set 
foot in the castle. 
ÒOf course, it became apparent 
to me very quickly that he had 
no extraordinary talent 
at all. He has fought
 his way out of a num-
ber of tight corners by a simple
 combination of 
sheer luck and 
more talented friends. He is medioc
re to the last degree, though as 
obnoxious and self-satisfied as wa
s his father before him. I have 
done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I be-
lieve he scarcely belongs, but kill 
him, or allow him to
 be killed in 
front of me? I would have been a f
ool to risk it with Dumbledore 
close at hand.Ó 
ÒAnd through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore 
has never suspected you?Ó asked Bellatrix. ÒHe has no idea of your 
true allegiance, he trusts
 you implicitly still?Ó 
ÒI have played my part well,Ó said Snape. ÒAnd you overlook 
DumbledoreÕs greatest weakness: He 
has to believe the best of peo-
ple. I spun him a tale of deepes
t remorse when I joined his staff, 
fresh from my Death Eater days, 
and he embraced me with open 
arms Ñ though, as I say, never al
lowing me nearer the Dark Arts 
than he could help. Dumbledore ha
s been a great wizard Ñ oh yes, 
he has,Ó (for Bellatrix had made 
a scathing noise), Òthe Dark Lord 
acknowledges it. I am pleased to 
say, however, that Dumbledore is 
growing old. The duel with the 
Dark Lord last month shook him. 
He has since sustained a serious 
injury because his reactions are 
slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has 
never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great 
value to the Dark Lord.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)*"
 53" Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how 
best to attack Snape next. Taking
 advantage of her silence, Snape 
turned to her sister. 
ÒNow . . . you came to as
k me for help, Narcissa?Ó 
Narcissa looked up at him, he
r face eloquent with despair. 
ÒYes, Severus. I Ñ I think you 
are the only one who can help 
me, I have nowhere else to turn. 
Lucius is in jail and . . .Ó 
She closed her eyes and two larg
e tears seeped from beneath her 
eyelids. 
ÒThe Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,Ó Narcissa con-
tinued, her eyes still closed. ÒHe wi
shes none to know of the plan. 
It is . . . very
 secret. But ÑÓ 
ÒIf he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,Ó said Snape at 
once. ÒThe Dark LordÕs word is law.Ó 
Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. 
Bellatrix looked satisfied for the fi
rst time since she had entered the 
house. 
ÒThere!Ó she said triumphantly to her sister. ÒEven Snape says 
so: You were told not to ta
lk, so hold your silence!Ó 
But Snape had gotten to his feet an
d strode to the small window, 
peered through the curtains at the 
deserted street, then closed them 
again with a jerk. He 
turned around to face
 Narcissa, frowning. 
ÒIt so happens that I know of the 
plan,Ó he said in a low voice. 
ÒI am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I 
not been in on the secret, Narcissa
, you would have been guilty of 
great treachery to 
the Dark Lord.Ó 
ÒI thought you must know about 
it!Ó said Narcissa, breathing 
more freely. ÒHe trusts 
you so, Severus. . . .Ó 
 -%.//'(0-""'/1"
 55" ÒYou know about the plan?Ó said
 Bellatrix, her fleeting expres-
sion of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. Ò
You
 know?Ó 
ÒCertainly,Ó said Snape. ÒBut what help do you require, Nar-
cissa? If you are imagining I can pe
rsuade the Dark Lord to change 
his mind, I am afraid there 
is no hope, none at all.Ó 
ÒSeverus,Ó she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. 
ÒMy son . . . my only son . . .Ó 
ÒDraco should be proud,Ó said Be
llatrix indifferently. ÒThe Dark 
Lord is granting him a great honor.
 And I will say this for Draco: 
He isnÕt shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to 
prove himself, excited at the prospect ÑÓ 
Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the 
while at Snape. 
ÒThatÕs because he is sixteen and ha
s no idea what lies in store! 
Why, Severus? Why my son? It is 
too dangerous! This is vengeance 
for LuciusÕs mistak
e, I know it!Ó 
Snape said nothing. He looked aw
ay from the sight of her tears 
as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear 
her. 
ÒThatÕs why heÕs chosen Draco, isnÕt it?Ó she persisted. ÒTo pun-
ish Lucius?Ó 
ÒIf Draco succeeds,Ó said Snape, st
ill looking away from her, Òhe 
will be honored ab
ove all others.Ó 
ÒBut he wonÕt succeed!Ó sobbed
 Narcissa. ÒHow can he, when 
the Dark Lord himself Ñ ?Ó 
Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve. 
ÒI only meant . . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus

the Dark LordÕs favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you 
speak to him, persuade him Ñ ?Ó 
ÒThe Dark Lord will not be pe
rsuaded, and I am not stupid 
enough to attempt it,Ó said Snape fl
atly. ÒI cannot pretend that the 
Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in 
charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and 
failed to retrieve the prophecy into
 the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord 
is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.Ó 
ÒThen I am right, he has chos
en Draco in revenge!Ó choked 
Narcissa. ÒHe does not mean him to
 succeed, he wants him to be 
killed trying!Ó 
When Snape said nothing, Narcissa
 seemed to lose what little 
self-restraint she still possessed. St
anding up, she staggered to Snape 
and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears 
falling onto his chest, sh
e gasped, ÒYou could do it. 
You could do it 
instead of Draco, Severus. You wo
uld succeed, of course you would, 
and he would reward you beyond all of us ÑÓ 
Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching 
hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, ÒHe 
intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that 
Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco 
succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, ful-
filling my useful role as spy.Ó 
ÒIn other words, it doe
snÕt matter to him if Draco is killed!Ó 
ÒThe Dark Lord is very angry,
Ó repeated Snape quietly. ÒHe 
failed to hear the prophecy. You kn
ow as well as I do, Narcissa, that 
he does not forgive easily.Ó 
 -%.//'(0-""'/1"
 57" She crumpled, falling at his fe
et, sobbing and moaning on the 
floor. 
ÒMy only son . . . my
 only son . . .Ó 
ÒYou should be proud!Ó said Bellatrix ruthlessly. ÒIf I had sons, I 
would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!Ó 
Narcissa gave a little scream of 
despair and clutched at her long 
blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, 
and steered her back onto the so
fa. He then poured her more wine 
and forced the gla
ss into her hand. 
ÒNarcissa, thatÕs enough. Dr
ink this. Listen to me.Ó 
She quieted a little; slopping wine
 down herself, she took a shaky 
sip. ÒIt might be possible . . 
. for me to help Draco.Ó 
She sat up, her face pape
r-white, her eyes huge. 
ÒSeverus Ñ oh, Severus Ñ you would help him? Would you 
look after him, see he comes to no harm?Ó 
ÒI can try.Ó 
She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off 
the sofa into a kneeling position at
 SnapeÕs feet, seized his hand in 
both of hers, and pres
sed her lips to it. 
ÒIf you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it? 
Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?Ó 
ÒThe Unbreakable Vow?Ó 
SnapeÕs expression was blank, unre
adable. Bellatrix, however, let 
out a cackle of tr
iumphant laughter. 
ÒArenÕt you listening, 
Narcissa? Oh, heÕll 
try, IÕm sure. . . . The 
usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action . . . oh, on the 
Dark LordÕs orders, of course!Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&)*"
 58" Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon 
NarcissaÕs tear-filled bl
ue ones as she continue
d to clutch his hand. 
ÒCertainly, Narcissa, I shall make
 the Unbreakable Vow,Ó he said 
quietly. ÒPerhaps your sister wi
ll consent to be our Bonder.Ó 
BellatrixÕs mouth fell open. Snape 
lowered himself so that he was 
kneeling opposite Narci
ssa. Beneath BellatrixÕs astonished gaze, they 
grasped right hands. 
ÒYou will need your wand, Be
llatrix,Ó said Snape coldly. 
She drew it, still looking astonished. 
ÒAnd you will need to move 
a little closer,Ó he said. 
She stepped forward so that she 
stood over them, and placed the 
tip of her wand on 
their linked hands. 
Narcissa spoke. 
ÒWill you, Severus, watch over my 
son, Draco, as he attempts to 
fulfill the Dark LordÕs wishes?Ó 
ÒI will,Ó said Snape. 
A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and 
wound its way around their 
hands like a red-hot wire. 
ÒAnd will you, to the best of 
your ability, protect him from 
harm?Ó 
ÒI will,Ó said Snape. 
A second tongue of flame shot 
from the wand and interlinked 
with the first, making 
a fine, glowing chain. 
ÒAnd, should it prove necessar
y . . . if it seems Draco will 
fail . . .Ó whispe
red Narcissa (SnapeÕs hand twitched within hers, 
but he did not draw away), Òwi

Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?Ó 
There was a momentÕs silence. Be
llatrix watched, her wand upon 
their clasped hands, her eyes wide.

 59" ÒI will,Ó said Snape. 
BellatrixÕs astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third 
tongue of flame, which shot from
 the wand, twisted with the oth-

thickly around their cl
asped hands, like a 
rope, like a fiery snake.

   arry Potter was snoring loudly
. He had been sitting in a 
chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of 
four hours, staring out at the 
darkening street, 
and had finally 
fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold win-
dowpane, his glasses askew and hi
s mouth wide open. The misty 
fug his breath had left on the win
dow sparkled in the orange glare 
of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of 
all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy 
black hair. 
The room was strewn with va
rious possessions and a good 
smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet 
wrappers littered the floor, a nu
mber of spellb
ooks lay higgledy-
piggledy among the tangled robe
s on his bed, and a mess of 
newspapers sat in a puddle of li
ght on his desk. The headline 
of one blared:

Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious re-
cent disturbance at the Mi
nistry of Magic, during 
which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted 
once more. 
ÒWeÕre not allowed to talk
 about it, donÕt ask me 
anything,Ó said one agitated Obliviator, who re-
fused to give his name as 
he left the Ministry last 
night. Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the 
Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance cen-
tered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy. 
Though Ministry spokes
wizards have hitherto 
refused even to confirm the existence of such a 
place, a growing number of the Wizarding commu-
nity believe that the Death Eaters now serving sen-
tences in Azkaban for tr
espass and attempted theft 
were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of 
that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is 
rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person 
ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and 
who is also known to have
 been at the Ministry on 
the night in question. Some are going so far as to 
call Potter Òthe Chosen 
One,Ó believing that the 
prophecy names him as the only one who will be 
able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it 
exists, are unknown, although (

 Rufus Scrimgeour, previous
ly Head of the Auror 
office in the Department
 of Magical Law Enforce-

Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted 
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, 
though rumors of a rift between the new Minister 
and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief 
Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours 
of Scrimgeour 
taking office. 
ScrimgeourÕs representatives admitted that he 
had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking 
possession of the top job, but refused to com-
ment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dum-
bledore is known to (

geour, spoke today of the tough new measures 
taken by his Ministry to 
ensure the safety of stu-
dents returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry this autumn. 
ÒFor obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be 
going into detail about its stringent new security 
plans,Ó said the Minister, although an insider con-
firmed that measures include defensive spells and 
charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a 
small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the 
protection of Hogwarts School. 
Most seem reassured by the new MinisterÕs 
tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta 
Longbottom, ÒMy grands

friend of Harry PotterÕs, incidentally, who fought 
the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in 
June and Ñ 
 But the rest of this story was 
obscured by the large birdcage 
standing on top of it. Inside it
 was a magnificent snowy owl. Her 
amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling 
occasionally to gaze at her sn
oring master. Once or twice she 
clicked her beak impatiently, but 
Harry was too deeply asleep to 
hear her. 
A large trunk stood in the very mi
ddle of the room. Its lid was 
open; it looked expectant; yet it 
was almost empty but for a residue 
of old underwear, sweets, empty ink 
bottles, and broken quills that

the floor, lay a purple leaflet 
emblazoned with the words:

 Harry grunted in his sleep and his 
face slid down the window an 
inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not 
wake up. An alarm cl
ock, repaired by Ha
rry several years ago, 
ticked loudly on the sill, showing 
one minute to eleven. Beside it, 
held in place by HarryÕs relaxe
d hand, was a piece of parchment 
covered in thin, slanting writing. 
Harry had read this letter so often 
since its arrival three days ago that
 although it had been delivered 
in a tightly furled scroll,
 it now lay quite flat. 
Dear Harry,
 If it is convenient to you, I 
shall call at number four, Privet 
Drive this coming Friday at eleven 
P.M. to escort you to the 
Burrow, where you have been in
vited to spend the remainder 
of your school holidays.
 If you are agreeable, I should al
so be glad of your assistance 
in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the 
Burrow. I shall explain this 
more fully when I see you.
 Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to 
see you this Friday,
 I am, yours most sincerely,
 !"#$%&'$(#")*+,)&
!#$%&'(""&#(''"
 33" Though he already knew it by 
heart, Harry had been stealing 
glances at this missive every few 
minutes since seven oÕclock that 
evening, when he had 
first taken up his posi
tion beside his bed-
room window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet 
Drive. He knew it was pointle
ss to keep rereading DumbledoreÕs 
words; Harry had sent back his ÒyesÓ with the delivering owl, as re-
quested, and all he could do now 
was wait: Either Dumbledore was 
going to come, or he was not. 
But Harry had not packed. It just
 seemed too good to be true 
that he was going to be rescued fr
om the Dursleys af
ter a mere fort-
night of their company. He coul
d not shrug off the feeling that 
something was going to go wrong 
Ñ his reply to DumbledoreÕs let-
ter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from 
collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumble-
dore at all, but a trick 
or joke or trap. Harry 
had not been able to 
face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. 
The only gesture he had made to th
e possibility of a journey was to 
shut his snowy owl, Hedw
ig, safely in her cage. The minute hand on the alarm cl
ock reached the number twelve 
and, at that precise moment, th
e streetlamp outside the window 
went out. 
Harry awoke as though the sudd
en darkness were an alarm. 
Hastily straightening hi
s glasses and unsticking
 his cheek from the 
glass, he pressed his nose agains
t the window inst
ead and squinted 
down at the pavement. A tall figure
 in a long, billowing cloak was 
walking up the garden path. 
Harry jumped up as though he ha
d received an electric shock, 
knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and every- 
 +,--""$./""+0.1&" 37" thing within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. 
Even as he lobbed a set of robes,
 two spellbooks, and a packet of 
crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living 
room his Uncle Vernon shouted, ÒWho
 the blazes is 
calling at this 
time of night?Ó 
Harry froze with a brass telescop
e in one hand and a pair of 
trainers in the other. He had co
mpletely forgotten to warn the 
Dursleys that Dumbledore might be
 coming. Feeling both panicky 
and close to laughter, he clambe
red over the trunk and wrenched 
open his bedroom door in time to 
hear a deep voice say, ÒGood 
evening. You must be Mr. Dursley.
 I daresay Harry has told you I 
would be coming for him?Ó 
Harry ran down the stairs two at 
a time, coming to an abrupt 
halt several steps from the bottom,
 as long experience had taught 
him to remain out of armÕs reach of his uncle whenever possible. 
There in the doorway stood a tall, t
hin man with wa
ist-length sil-
ver hair and beard. Half-moon sp
ectacles were perched on his 
crooked nose, and he was wearing 
a long black traveling cloak and 
a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, wh
ose mustache was quite as bushy 
as DumbledoreÕs, though black, 
and who was wearing a puce dress-
ing gown, was staring at the visito
r as though he could not believe 
his tiny eyes. 
ÒJudging by your look of 
stunned disbelief, Harry did 
not warn 
you that I was coming,Ó said Du
mbledore pleasantly. ÒHowever, let 
us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is 
unwise to linger overlong on doo
rsteps in these troubled times.Ó 
He stepped smartly over the thre
shold and closed the front door 
behind him. 
 !#$%&'(""&#(''"
 38" ÒIt is a long time since my last visit,Ó said Dumbledore, peering 
down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. ÒI must say, your agapan-
thus are flourishing.Ó 
Vernon Dursley said nothing at
 all. Harry did not doubt that 
speech would return to him, and soon Ñ the vein pulsing in his 
uncleÕs temple was reaching danger point Ñ but something about 
Dumbledore seemed to have robbed
 him temporarily of breath. It 
might have been the blatant wizard
ishness of his appearance, but it 
might, too, have been that even
 Uncle Vernon could sense that 
here was a man whom it would 
be very difficul
t to bully. 
ÒAh, good evening Harry,Ó said 
Dumbledore, looking up at him 
through his half-moon glasses with
 a most satisfied expression. 
ÒExcellent, excellent.Ó 
These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as 
far as he was concerned, any man 
who could look at Harry and say 
ÒexcellentÓ was a man with whom 
he could never see eye to eye. 
ÒI donÕt mean to be rude ÑÓ he 
began, in a tone that threatened 
rudeness in every syllable. 
ÒÑ yet, sadly, accidental rud
eness occurs alarmingly often,Ó 
Dumbledore finished the sentence gr
avely. ÒBest to say nothing at 
all, my dear man. Ah, an
d this must be Petunia.Ó 
The kitchen door had opened, and there stood HarryÕs aunt, 
wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly 
halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen 
surfaces. Her rather horsey face
 registered nothing but shock. 
ÒAlbus Dumbledore,Ó said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon 
failed to effect an introduction. ÒWe have corresponded, of course.Ó 
Harry thought this an odd way of re
minding Aunt Petunia that he  
 +,--""$./""+0.1&" 39" had once sent her an exploding 
letter, but Aunt Petunia did not 
challenge the term. ÒAnd this 
must be your son, Dudley?Ó 
Dudley had that moment peered
 round the living room door. 
His large, blond head rising out of
 the stripy collar of his pajamas 
looked oddly disembodied, his mout
h gaping in astonishment and 
fear. Dumbledore waited a moment
 or two, apparently to see 
whether any of the Dursleys were 
going to say anything, but as the 
silence stretched on he smiled. 
ÒShall we assume that you have 
invited me into your sitting 
room? Dudley scrambled out of the 
way as Dumbledore passed him. 
Harry, still clutching 
the telescope and traine
rs, jumped the last 
few stairs and followed Dumbledo
re, who had sett
led himself in 
the armchair nearest the fire and 
was taking in the surroundings 
with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordi-
narily out of place. 
ÒArenÕt Ñ arenÕt we leaving, sir?Ó Harry asked anxiously. 
ÒYes, indeed we are, but there 
are a few matters we need to dis-
cuss first,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒAnd
 I would prefer not to do so in 
the open. We shall trespass upon yo
ur aunt and uncleÕs hospitality 
only a little longer.Ó 
ÒYou will, will you?Ó 
Vernon Dursley had entered the 
room, Petunia at his shoulder, 
and Dudley skulking behind them both. 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledor
e simply, ÒI shall.Ó 
He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a ca-
sual flick, the sofa zoomed fo
rward and knocke
d the knees out 
from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it  
 !#$%&'(""&#(''"
 3*" in a heap. Another flick of the wa
nd and the sofa zoomed back to 
its original position. 
ÒWe may as well be comfortable,
Ó said Dumbledore pleasantly. 
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand 
was blackened and shriveled; it look
ed as though his flesh had been 
burned away. 
ÒSir Ñ what happened to your Ñ ?Ó 
ÒLater, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒPlease sit down.Ó 
Harry took the remaining armchair
, choosing not to look at the 
Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence. 
ÒI would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,Ó 
Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, 
Òbut the evidence so far sug-
gests that that would be optimist
ic to the point of foolishness.Ó 
A third twitch of the wand, and 
a dusty bottle and five glasses 
appeared in midair. The bottle ti
pped and poured a generous mea-
sure of honey-colored liquid into 
each of the glasses, which then 
floated to each person in the room. 
ÒMadam RosmertaÕs finest oak-
matured mead,Ó said Dumble-
dore, raising his glass to Harry, 
who caught hold of his own and 
sipped. He had never tasted anythi
ng like it before, but enjoyed 
it immensely. The Dursleys, after 
quick, scared looks at one an-
other, tried to ignore their glasse
s completely, a difficult feat, as 
they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry 
could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoy-
ing himself. 
ÒWell, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore,
 turning toward him, Òa diffi-
culty has arisen which I hope you wi
ll be able to solve for us. By 
us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But 
first of all I must tell you that  
 +,--""$./""+0.1&" 32" SiriusÕs will was discovered a week
 ago and that he left you every-
thing he owned.Ó 
Over on the sofa, Uncle VernonÕs head turned, but Harry did 
not look at him, nor could he think 
of anything to say except, ÒOh. 
Right.Ó ÒThis is, in the main, fairly st
raightforward,Ó Dumbledore went 
on. ÒYou add a reasonable amount
 of gold to your account at 
Gringotts, and you inherit all of 
SiriusÕs personal possessions. The 
slightly problematic pa
rt of the legacy ÑÓ 
ÒHis godfatherÕs dead?Ó said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. 
Dumbledore and Harry both turned 
to look at him. The glass of 
mead was now knocking 
quite insistently on th
e side of VernonÕs 
head; he attempted to beat it 
away. ÒHeÕs dead? 
His godfather?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not 
confided in the Dursleys. ÒOur pr
oblem,Ó he continued to Harry, 
as if there had been no interruption,
 Òis that Sirius also left you 
number twelve, Grimmauld Place.Ó 
ÒHeÕs been left a house?Ó said 
Uncle Vernon greedily, his small 
eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him. 
ÒYou can keep using it as head
quarters,Ó said Harry. ÒI donÕt 
care. You can have it, I donÕt really
 want it.Ó Harry 
never wanted to 
set foot in number twelve, Grimma
uld Place again if he could help 
it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of 
Sirius prowling its dark musty 
rooms alone, imprisoned within 
the place he had wanted so
 desperately to leave. 
ÒThat is generous,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWe have, however, va-
cated the building temporarily.Ó 
ÒWhy?Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&#(''"
 74" ÒWell,Ó said Dumbledore, igno
ring the mutterings of Uncle 
Vernon, who was now being rapped 
smartly over the head by the 
persistent glass of mead, ÒBlack
 family tradition decreed that 
the house was handed down the direct
 line, to the next male with the 
name of ÔBlack.Õ Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger 
brother, Regulus, predeceased him 
and both were childless. While 
his will makes it perfectly plain that
 he wants you to have the house, 
it is nevertheless possible that so
me spell or enchantment has been 
set upon the place to ensure that
 it cannot be owned by anyone 
other than a pureblood.Ó 
A vivid image of the sh
rieking, spitting po
rtrait of SiriusÕs 
mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place 
flashed into HarryÕs mind. ÒI bet there has,Ó he said. 
ÒQuite,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒAnd 
if such an enchantment exists, 
then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest 
of SiriusÕs living relatives, whic
h would mean his cousin, Bellatrix 
Lestrange.Ó 
Without realizing what he was 
doing, Harry sprang to his feet; 
the telescope and trainers in his la
p rolled across the floor. Bellatrix 
Lestrange, SiriusÕs kille
r, inherit his house? 
ÒNo,Ó he said. 
ÒWell, obviously we would prefer that she didnÕt get it either,Ó 
said Dumbledore calmly. ÒThe situation is fraught with complica-
tions. We do not know whether 
the enchantments we ourselves 
have placed upon it, for example, 
making it Unplottable, will hold 
now that ownership has passed from Si
riusÕs hands. It might be that 
Bellatrix will arrive on the doorst
ep at any moment. Naturally we 
had to move out until such time as
 we have clarified the position.Ó 
ÒBut how are you going to find 
out if IÕm allowe
d to own it?Ó 
+,--""$./""+0.1&" 75" ÒFortunately,Ó said Dumbledore
, Òthere is a simple test.Ó 
He placed his empty glass on a sm
all table beside his chair, but 
before he could do anything el
se, Uncle Vernon shouted, Ò
Will you 
get these ruddy things off us
?Ó Harry looked around; all three of
 the Dursleys were cowering 
with their arms over their heads 
as their glasses bounced up and 
down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere. 
ÒOh, IÕm so sorry,Ó said Dumbledo
re politely, and he raised his 
wand again. All three glasses va
nished. ÒBut it would have been 
better manners to drink it, you know.Ó 
It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any num-
ber of unpleasant retorts, but he 
merely shrank back into the cush-
ions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his 
small piggy eyes on 
DumbledoreÕs wand. 
ÒYou see,Ó Dumbledore said, turn
ing back to Harry and again 
speaking as though Uncle Vernon 
had not uttered, Òif you have in-
deed inherited the house, you have also inherited ÑÓ 
He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and 
a house-elf appeared, with a snout 
for a nose, giant batÕs ears, and 
enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching 
on the DursleysÕ shag carpet 
and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising 
shriek; nothing this filthy had ent
ered her house in living memory. 
Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with 
them raised almost above his head
, as though he thought the crea-
ture might run up his pajama 
trousers, and Uncle Vernon bel-
lowed, ÒWhat the 
hell is that?Ó 
ÒKreacher,Ó finished Dumbledore. 
ÒKreacher wonÕt, Kreacher wonÕt,
 Kreacher wonÕt!Ó croaked the 
house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, 
!#$%&'(""&#(''"
 76" gnarled feet and pulling his ears. ÒKreacher belongs to Miss Bella-
trix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to
 the Blacks, Kreacher wants his 
new mistress, Kreacher wonÕt go to the Potter brat, Kreacher wonÕt, 
wonÕt, wonÕt ÑÓ 
ÒAs you can see, Harry,Ó said Du
mbledore loudly, over KreacherÕs 
continued croaks of ÒwonÕt, wonÕt,
 wonÕt,Ó ÒKreacher is showing a 
certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.Ó 
ÒI donÕt care,Ó said Harry again,
 looking with disgust at the 
writhing, stamping house-elf. ÒI donÕt want him.Ó 
ÒWonÕt, wonÕt, wonÕt, wonÕt
 ÑÓ 
ÒYou would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix 
Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he
 has lived at the headquarters of 
the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?Ó 
ÒWonÕt, wonÕt, wonÕt, wonÕt
 ÑÓ 
Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not 
be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of 
owning him, of having responsibili
ty for the creature that had be-
trayed Sirius, 
was repugnant. 
ÒGive him an order,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒIf he has passed into 
your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to 
think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mis-
tress.Ó ÒWonÕt, wonÕt, wonÕt, WONÕT
!Ó KreacherÕs voice had risen to 
a scream. Harry could think of 
nothing to say, except, ÒKreacher, shut up!Ó 
It looked for a moment as though
 Kreacher was going to choke. 
He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes 
bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself 
face forward onto the carpet (A
unt Petunia whimpered) and beat 
+,--""$./""+0.1&" 7)" the floor with his hands and feet, gi
ving himself over to a violent, 
but entirely silent, tantrum. 
ÒWell, that simplifies matters,
Ó said Dumbledore cheerfully. ÒIt 
seems that Sirius knew what he
 was doing. You are the rightful 
owner of number twelve, Grimma
uld Place and of
 Kreacher.Ó 
ÒDo I Ñ do I have to keep him with me?Ó Harry asked, aghast, 
as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 
ÒNot if you donÕt want
 to,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒIf I might make 
a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the 
kitchen there. In that way, the ot
her house-elves could keep an eye 
on him.Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry in relief, Òyeah,
 IÕll do that. Er Ñ Kreacher Ñ 
I want you to go to Hogwarts and 
work in the kitchens there with 
the other house-elves.Ó 
Kreacher, who was now lying flat 
on his back with his arms and 
legs in the air, gave Harry on
e upside-down look of deepest 
loathing and, with anothe
r loud crack, vanished. 
ÒGood,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒThere is also the matter of the hip-
pogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has be
en looking after him since Sirius 
died, but Buckbeak is yours now, 
so if you would prefer to make 
different arrangements ÑÓ 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry at once, Òhe can stay with Hagrid. I think 
Buckbeak would prefer that.Ó 
ÒHagrid will be delighted,Ó said
 Dumbledore, smiling. ÒHe was 
thrilled to see Buckbeak
 again. Incidentally, 
we have decided, in 
the interests of BuckbeakÕs safety, to rechristen him ÔWitherwingsÕ 
for the time being, though I doubt
 that the Ministry would ever 
guess he is the hippogriff they 
once sentenced to death. Now, 
Harry, is your trunk packed?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&#(''"
 73" ÒErm . . .Ó 
ÒDoubtful that I would turn up?Ó Dumbledore suggested 
shrewdly. 
ÒIÕll just go and Ñ er Ñ finish 
off,Ó said Harry hastily, hurrying 
to pick up his fallen 
telescope and trainers. 
It took him a little over ten mi
nutes to track dow
n everything he 
needed; at last he had managed to
 extract his Invisibility Cloak 
from under the bed, screwed the 
top back on his jar of color-
change ink, and forced the lid of
 his trunk shut on his cauldron. 
Then, heaving his trunk in one hand
 and holding HedwigÕs cage in 
the other, he made his way back downstairs. 
He was disappointed to discover
 that Dumbledore was not wait-
ing in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living 
room. Nobody was talking. Dumbledor
e was humming quietly, appar-
ently quite at his ease, but the at
mosphere was thicker than cold 
custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, 
ÒProfessor Ñ IÕm ready now.Ó 
ÒGood,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒJust o
ne last thing, then.Ó And he 
turned to speak to the Dursleys once more. 
ÒAs you will no doubt be aware,
 Harry comes of age in a yearÕs 
time ÑÓ 
ÒNo,Ó said Aunt Petunia, speaki
ng for the first time since Dum-
bledoreÕs arrival. 
ÒIÕm sorry?Ó said Dumbledore politely. 
ÒNo, he doesnÕt. HeÕs a month 
younger than Dudl
ey, and Dudders 
doesnÕt turn eighteen unti
l the year after next.Ó 
ÒAh,Ó said Dumbledore pleasantly, 
Òbut in the Wizarding world, 
we come of age 
at seventeen.Ó 
+,--""$./""+0.1&" 77" Uncle Vernon muttered, ÒPrepo
sterous,Ó but Dumbledore ig-
nored him. 
ÒNow, as you already know, the 
wizard called Lord Voldemort 
has returned to this country. 
The Wizarding community is cur-
rently in a state of open warfar
e. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has 
already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even 
greater danger now than the da
y when I left him upon your 
doorstep fifteen ye
ars ago, with a letter 
explaining about his par-
entsÕ murder and expressing the ho
pe that you would care for him 
as though he we
re your own.Ó 
Dumbledore paused, and although 
his voice remained light and 
calm, and he gave no obvious sign
 of anger, Harry felt a kind of 
chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very 
slightly closer together. 
ÒYou did not do as I asked. You 
have never treated Harry as a 
son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your 
hands. The best that can be said is
 that he has at least escaped the 
appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sit-
ting between you.Ó 
Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Ve
rnon looked around instinc-
tively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley 
squeezed between them. 
ÒUs Ñ mistreat Dudders? What
 dÕyou Ñ ?Ó began Uncle Ver-
non furiously, but Dumbledore rais
ed his finger for silence, a si-
lence which fell as though he 
had struck Uncle Vernon dumb. 
ÒThe magic I evoked fifteen year
s ago means that Harry has pow-
erful protection while he can stil
l call this house Ôhome.Õ However 
miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly 
treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This 
!#$%&'(""&#(''"
 78" magic will cease to operate the mo
ment that Harry turns seventeen; 
in other words, at the moment he
 becomes a man. I ask only this: 
that you allow Harry to return, once 
more, to this house, before his 
seventeenth birthday, which will ens
ure that the protection contin-
ues until that time.Ó 
None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning 
slightly, as though he was still t
rying to work out when he had ever 
been mistreated. Uncle 
Vernon looked as thou
gh he had something 
stuck in his throat; Aunt Petuni
a, however, was 
oddly flushed. 
ÒWell, Harry . . . time for us to be off,Ó said Dumbledore at last, 
standing up and straightening his lo
ng black cloak. ÒUntil we meet 
again,Ó he said to the Dursleys, wh
o looked as though that moment 
could wait forever as far as they
 were concerned, and after doffing 
his hat, he swept from the room. 
ÒBye,Ó said Harry hastily to th
e Dursleys, and followed Dum-
bledore, who paused beside Harry
Õs trunk, upon which HedwigÕs 
cage was perched. 
ÒWe do not want to be encumbered 
by these just now,Ó he said, 
pulling out his wand again. ÒI shall send them to the Burrow to 
await us there. However, I would li
ke you to bring yo
ur Invisibility 
Cloak . . . just
 in case.Ó 
Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, 
trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had 
stuffed it into an inside pocket
 of his jacket, Dumbledore waved 
his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore 
then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, 
misty darkness. 
ÒAnd now, Harry, let us step out 
into the night and pursue that 
flighty temptre
ss, adventure.Ó 
!"#"$"%"&"'"("")"*"+"("
"",-" #*($!'"./+0#*(1"
   espite the fact that he had 
spent every waking moment of 
the past few days hoping de
sperately that Dumbledore 
would indeed come to fetch him, 
Harry felt distinctly awkward as 
they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper 
conversation with the headmaster
 outside of Ho
gwarts before; 
there was usually a desk between 
them. The memory of their last 
face-to-face encounter kept intrud
ing too, and it rather heightened 
HarryÕs sense of embarra
ssment; he had shouted 
a lot on that occa-
sion, not to mention done his best
 to smash several of Dumble-
doreÕs most prized possessions. 
Dumbledore, however, seem
ed completely relaxed. 
ÒKeep your wand at the read
y, Harry,Ó he said brightly. 
ÒBut I thought IÕm not allowed to
 use magic outside school, sir?Ó 
ÒIf there is an attack,Ó said Du
mbledore, ÒI give you permission 
to use any counterjinx 
or curse that might occur to you. However, 
I do not think you need worry ab
out being attacked tonight.Ó 
2"!#$%&'("")*+("
 ,3" ÒWhy not, sir?Ó 
ÒYou are with me,Ó said Dumb
ledore simply. ÒThis will do, 
Harry.Ó 
He came to an abrupt halt 
at the end of Privet Drive. 
ÒYou have not, of course, passed 
your Apparition Test,Ó he said. ÒNo,Ó said Harry. ÒI thought 
you had to be seventeen?Ó 
ÒYou do,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒSo you 
will need to hold on to my 
arm very tightly. My left, if you donÕt mind Ñ as you have noticed, 
my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.Ó 
Harry gripped DumbledoreÕ
s proffered forearm. 
ÒVery good,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWell, here we go.Ó 
Harry felt DumbledoreÕs arm twist away from him and redou-
bled his grip; the next thing he 
knew, everything went black; he 
was being pressed very hard from
 all directions; he could not 
breathe, there were iron bands tigh
tening around his chest; his eye-
balls were being forced back into 
his head; his eardrums were being 
pushed deeper into his skull and then Ñ 
He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his 
streaming eyes. He felt as though 
he had just been forced through 
a very tight rubber tube. It was a fe
w seconds before he
 realized that 
Privet Drive had vanished. He 
and Dumbledore were now stand-
ing in what appeared to be a dese
rted village square
, in the center 
of which stood an old war memori
al and a few be
nches. His com-
prehension catching up with his se
nses, Harry realized that he had 
just Apparated for the first time in his life. 
ÒAre you all right?Ó asked Dumb
ledore, looking down at him so-
licitously. ÒThe sensation does 
take some getting used to.Ó 
ÒIÕm fine,Ó said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though  
 #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 ,4" they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. ÒBut I think I might 
prefer brooms. . . .Ó 
Dumbledore smiled, drew his tr
aveling cloak a little more 
tightly around his neck
, and said, ÒThis way.Ó 
He set off at a brisk pace, past
 an empty inn and a few houses. 
According to a clock on a nearby 
church, it was almost midnight. 
ÒSo tell me, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒYour scar . . . has it been 
hurting at all?Ó 
Harry raised a hand unconsciousl
y to his forehead and rubbed 
the lightning-shaped mark. 
ÒNo,Ó he said, Òand IÕve been wondering about that. I thought it 
would be burning all the time no
w VoldemortÕs getting so power-
ful again.Ó 
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a 
satisfied expression. 
ÒI, on the other hand, thought 
otherwise,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒLord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his 
thoughts and feelings you have been 
enjoying. It appears that he is 
now employing Occlumency against you.Ó 
ÒWell, IÕm not complaining,Ó sa
id Harry, who missed neither 
the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into 
VoldemortÕs mind. 
They turned a corner, passing a 
telephone box and a bus shelter. 
Harry looked sideways at Du
mbledore again. ÒProfessor?Ó 
ÒHarry?Ó ÒEr Ñ where exactly are we?Ó 
ÒThis, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.Ó 
ÒAnd what are we doing here?Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*+("
 56" ÒAh yes, of course, I havenÕt told
 you,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWell, 
I have lost count of the number of 
times I have said this in recent 
years, but we are, once again, on
e member of staff short. We are 
here to persuade an old colleague 
of mine to come out of retire-
ment and return to Hogwarts.Ó 
ÒHow can I help with that, sir?Ó ÒOh, I think weÕll find a use fo
r you,Ó said Dumbledore vaguely. 
ÒLeft here, Harry.Ó 
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All 
the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet 
Drive for two weeks persisted here
 too. Thinking of dementors, 
Harry cast a look over his should
er and grasped his wand reassur-
ingly in his pocket. 
ÒProfessor, why couldnÕt we just 
Apparate directly into your old 
colleagueÕs house?Ó 
ÒBecause it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front 
door,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒCourtesy 
dictates that we offer fellow 
wizards the opportunity of denyin
g us entry. In any case, most 
Wizarding dwellings are magically
 protected from unwanted Ap-
parators. At Hogwarts
, for instance ÑÓ 
ÒÑ you canÕt Apparate anywhe
re inside the buildings or 
grounds,Ó said Harry quickly. 
ÒHermione Granger told me.Ó 
ÒAnd she is quite right. We turn left again.Ó 
The church clock chimed midn
ight behind them. Harry won-
dered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old 
colleague so late, but now that co
nversation had been established, 
he had more pressing questions to ask. 
ÒSir, I saw in the 
Daily Prophet
 that Fudge has been sacked. . . .Ó 
ÒCorrect,Ó said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. 
#*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 57" ÒHe has been replaced, as I am sure
 you also saw, by Rufus Scrim-
geour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.Ó 
ÒIs he . . . Do you think 
heÕs good?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒAn interesting question,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒHe is able, cer-
tainly. A more decisive and forcef
ul personality than Cornelius.Ó 
ÒYes, but I meant ÑÓ 
ÒI know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having 
fought Dark wizards for most of
 his working life, does not under-
estimate Lord Voldemort.Ó 
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the 
disagreement with Scrimgeour that the 
Daily Prophet
 had reported, 
and he did not have the nerve to pu
rsue the subject, so he changed 
it. ÒAnd . . . sir . . . 
I saw about Madam Bones.Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore quietly. 
ÒA terrible loss. She was a great 
witch. Just up here, I think Ñ ouch.Ó 
He had pointed with his injured hand. 
ÒProfessor, what happ
ened to your Ñ ?Ó 
ÒI have no time to explain no
w,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒIt is a 
thrilling tale, I wish
 to do it justice.Ó 
He smiled at Harry, who unde
rstood that he was not being 
snubbed, and that he 
had permission to keep
 asking questions. 
ÒSir Ñ I got a Ministry of Magic 
leaflet by owl, about security 
measures we should all take ag
ainst the Death Eaters. . . .Ó 
ÒYes, I received one myself,Ó said Dumbledore, still smiling. 
ÒDid you find it useful?Ó 
ÒNot really.Ó 
ÒNo, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is 
my favorite flavor of jam, to 
check that I am indeed Professor 
Dumbledore and not 
an impostor.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+("
 58" ÒI didnÕt . . .Ó Harry 
began, not entirely sure whether he was be-
ing reprimanded or not. 
ÒFor future reference, Harry, it 
is raspberry . . . although of 
course, if I were a Death Eater, I 
would have been sure to research 
my own jam preferences befo
re impersonating myself.Ó 
ÒEr . . . right,Ó said Harry. ÒWell, 
on that leaflet, it said some-
thing about Inferi. What exactly 
are they? The leaflet wasnÕt very 
clear.Ó 
ÒThey are corpses,Ó said Dumble
dore calmly. ÒDead bodies that 
have been bewitched to do a Dark wi
zardÕs bidding. Inferi have not 
been seen for a long 
time, however, not since Voldemort was last 
powerful. . . . He killed
 enough people to make an army of them, 
of course. This is the place,
 Harry, just here. . . .Ó 
They were nearing a small, neat
 stone house set in its own gar-
den. Harry was too busy
 digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to 
have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the 
front gate, Dumbledore stopped 
dead and Harry walked into him. 
ÒOh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.Ó 
Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and 
felt his heart sink. The front 
door was hanging 
off its hinges. 
Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite 
deserted. ÒWand out and follow me, Ha
rry,Ó he said quietly. 
He opened the gate and walked 
swiftly and silently up the gar-
den path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, 
his wand raised and at the ready. 
ÒLumos.
Ó DumbledoreÕs wand tip ignited, 
casting its light up a narrow 
hallway. To the left, another door
 stood open. Holding his illumi-
#*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 59" nated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with 
Harry right behind him. 
A scene of total devastation met 
their eyes. A grandfather clock 
lay splintered at their feet, its face
 cracked, its pendulum lying a lit-
tle farther away like a dropped sw
ord. A piano was on its side, its 
keys strewn across the floor. The wr
eckage of a fallen chandelier 
glittered nearby. Cushions lay defl
ated, feathers oozing from slashes 
in their sides; fragments of gla
ss and china lay like powder over 
everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its 
light was thrown upon the walls,
 where something darkly red and 
glutinous was spattered over the wa
llpaper. HarryÕs small intake of 
breath made Dumbledore look around. 
ÒNot pretty, is it?Ó he said heavily. ÒYes, something horrible has 
happened here.Ó 
Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scru-
tinizing the wreckage at his fee
t. Harry followed, gazing around, 
half-scared of what he might see 
hidden behind the wreck of the pi-
ano or the overturned sofa, but 
there was no sign of a body. 
ÒMaybe there was a fight and Ñ 
and they dragged him off, Pro-
fessor?Ó Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly 
wounded a man would have to be 
to leave those stains spattered 
halfway up 
the walls. 
ÒI donÕt think so,Ó said Dumble
dore quietly, peering behind an 
overstuffed armchair 
lying on its side. 
ÒYou mean heÕs Ñ ?Ó 
ÒStill here somewhere? Yes.Ó 
And without warning, Dumbledore 
swooped, plunging the tip of 
his wand into the seat of the ov
erstuffed armchair, which yelled, 
ÒOuch!Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+("
 5:" ÒGood evening, Horace,Ó said Dumbledore, straightening up 
again. HarryÕs jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been 
an armchair, there now crouched 
an enormously fat, bald, old man 
who was massaging his lower belly
 and squinting up at Dumble-
dore with an aggrieved and watery eye. 
ÒThere was no need to stick the 
wand in that hard,Ó he said 
gruffly, clambering to
 his feet. ÒIt hurt.Ó 
The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, 
his enormous, silver, walruslike 
mustache, and the highly polished 
buttons on the maroon velvet jacket
 he was wearing over a pair of 
lilac silk pajamas. The top of his
 head barely reached DumbledoreÕs 
chin. ÒWhat gave it away?Ó he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still 
rubbing his lower belly. He seem
ed remarkably 
unabashed for a 
man who had just been 
discovered pretending to be an armchair. 
ÒMy dear Horace,Ó said Dumble
dore, looking amused, Òif the 
Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have 
been set over the house.Ó 
The wizard clapped a pudgy ha
nd to his vast forehead. 
ÒThe Dark Mark,Ó he muttered. ÒKnew there was something 
. . . ah well. WouldnÕt have had ti
me anyway, IÕd only just put the 
finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.Ó 
He heaved a great sigh that 
made the ends of his mustache 
flutter. 
ÒWould you like my assistance 
clearing up?Ó asked Dumbledore 
politely. ÒPlease,Ó said the other. 
 #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 5," They stood back to back, the ta
ll thin wizard and the short 
round one, and waved their wa
nds in one identical sweeping 
motion. 
The furniture flew back to its 
original places; ornaments re-
formed in midair, feathers zoomed 
into their cushions; torn books 
repaired themselves as they landed
 upon their shelves; oil lanterns 
soared onto side tables 
and reignited; a vast collection of splintered 
silver picture frames flew glitte
ring across the room and alighted, 
whole and untarnished, upon a desk
; rips, cracks, and holes healed 
everywhere, and the walls 
wiped themselves clean. 
ÒWhat kind of blood was that, in
cidentally?Ó asked Dumbledore 
loudly over the chiming of th
e newly unsmashed grandfather 
clock. ÒOn the walls? Dragon,Ó shouted the wizard called Horace, as, 
with a deafening grinding and tink
ling, the chandelier screwed it-
self back into the ceiling. 
There was a final 
plunk
 from the piano, and silence. 
ÒYes, dragon,Ó repeated the wizard conversationally. ÒMy last 
bottle, and prices are sky-high at 
the moment. Still, it might be 
reusable.Ó 
He stumped over to a small crysta
l bottle standing on top of a 
sideboard and held it up to the 
light, examining the thick liquid 
within. ÒHmm. Bit dusty.Ó 
He set the bottle back on the 
sideboard and sighed. It was then 
that his gaze fel
l upon Harry. 
ÒOho,Ó he said, his large round eyes flying to HarryÕs forehead 
and the lightning-shap
ed scar it bore. Ò
Oho!Ó  !#$%&'("")*+("
 55" ÒThis,Ó said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the intro-
duction, Òis Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague 
of mine, Horace Slughorn.Ó 
Slughorn turned on Dumbledore,
 his expression shrewd. ÒSo 
thatÕs how you thought youÕd persua
de me, is it? Well, the answerÕs 
no, Albus.Ó 
He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the 
air of a man trying to resist temptation. 
ÒI suppose we can have a drink,
 at least?Ó asked Dumbledore. 
ÒFor old timeÕs sake?Ó 
Slughorn hesitated. 
ÒAll right then, one drink,
Ó he said ungraciously. 
Dumbledore smiled at Harry and 
directed him toward a chair 
not unlike the one that Slughorn
 had so recently impersonated, 
which stood right beside the newl
y burning fire and a brightly 
glowing oil lamp. Harry took the se
at with the distinct impression 
that Dumbledore, for some reason, 
wanted to keep him as visible 
as possible. Certainly when Slugho
rn, who had been busy with de-
canters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell im-
mediately upon Harry. 
ÒHmpf,Ó he said, looking away qu
ickly as though frightened of 
hurting his eyes. ÒHere ÑÓ He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who 
had sat down without invitation, th
rust the tray at Harry, and then 
sank into the cushions of the re
paired sofa and a disgruntled si-
lence. His legs were so shor
t they did not touch the floor. 
ÒWell, how have you been keeping, Horace?Ó Dumbledore 
asked. 
ÒNot so well,Ó said Slughorn at once. ÒWeak chest. Wheezy.  
 #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 5-" Rheumatism too. CanÕt move like I 
used to. Well, thatÕs to be ex-
pected. Old age. Fatigue.Ó 
ÒAnd yet you must have moved fa
irly quickly to prepare such a 
welcome for us at such short noti
ce,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒYou canÕt 
have had more than th
ree minutesÕ warning?Ó 
Slughorn said, half irritably, half
 proudly, ÒTwo. DidnÕt hear my 
Intruder Charm go off, I was taking
 a bath. Still,Ó he added sternly, 
seeming to pull himself back togeth
er again, Òthe fact remains that 
IÕm an old man, Albus. A tired ol
d man whoÕs earned the right to a 
quiet life and a few creature comforts.Ó 
He certainly had those, thou
ght Harry, looking around the 
room. It was stuffy and cluttered,
 yet nobody could say it was un-
comfortable; there were soft ch
airs and footstoo
ls, drinks and 
books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not 
known who lived there, he would ha
ve guessed at a rich, fussy old 
lady. ÒYouÕre not yet as old as I am
, Horace,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒWell, maybe you ought to thin
k about retirement yourself,Ó 
said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dum-
bledoreÕs injured hand. ÒReactions
 not what they were, I see.Ó 
ÒYouÕre quite right,Ó said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his 
sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the 
sight of them made th
e back of HarryÕs neck
 prickle unpleasantly. 
ÒI am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . .Ó 
He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that 
age had its compensations, and Ha
rry noticed a ring on his unin-
jured hand that he had never s
een Dumbledore wear before: It was 
large, rather clumsily made of wh
at looked like gold, and was set  
 !#$%&'("")*+("
 53" with a heavy black stone that
 had cracked down the middle. 
SlughornÕs eyes lingered for a mo
ment on the ring too, and Harry 
saw a tiny frown momentarily 
crease his wide forehead. 
ÒSo, all these precautions against intruders, Horace . . . are they 
for the Death EatersÕ benefit, 
or mine?Ó asked Dumbledore. 
ÒWhat would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down 
old buffer like me?Ó
 demanded Slughorn. 
ÒI imagine that they would want 
you to turn your considerable 
talents to coercion, torture, and 
murder,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒAre 
you really telling me that they havenÕt come recruiting yet?Ó 
Slughorn eyed Dumbledore bale
fully for a moment, then mut-
tered, ÒI havenÕt given them the chance. IÕve been on the move for 
a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Mug-
gle house to Muggle house Ñ the owners of this place are on holi-
day in the Canary Islands Ñ itÕs b
een very pleasant, IÕll be sorry to 
leave. ItÕs quite easy once yo
u know how, one simple Freezing 
Charm on these absurd burglar alar
ms they use instead of Sneako-
scopes and make sure the neighbors donÕt spot you bringing in the 
piano.Ó 
ÒIngenious,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒBut it sounds a rather tiring ex-
istence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, 
if you were to return to Hogwarts ÑÓ 
ÒIf youÕre going to tell me my li
fe would be more peaceful at that 
pestilential school, you can save 
your breath, Albus! I might have 
been in hiding, but some funny ru
mors have reached me since Do-
lores Umbridge left! If thatÕs how 
you treat teachers
 these days ÑÓ 
ÒProfessor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,Ó said Dum-
bledore. ÒI think you, Horace, would have known better than to  
 #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 54" stride into the forest and call a ho
rde of angry centaurs Ôfilthy half-
breeds.ÕÓ 
ÒThatÕs what she did, did she?Ó 
said Slughorn. ÒIdiotic woman. 
Never liked her.Ó 
Harry chuckled and both Dumb
ledore and Slughorn looked 
round at him. 
ÒSorry,Ó Harry said hastily. ÒItÕs ju
st Ñ I didnÕt like her either.Ó 
Dumbledore stood up 
rather suddenly. 
ÒAre you leaving?Ó asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful. 
ÒNo, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒOh,Ó said Slughorn, clearly disa
ppointed. ÒSecond on the left 
down the hall.Ó 
Dumbledore strode from the r
oom. Once the door had closed 
behind him, there was silence. Af
ter a few moments, Slughorn got 
to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a 
furtive look at Harry, then crossed 
to the fire and turned his back 
on it, warming hi
s wide behind. 
ÒDonÕt think I donÕt know why 
heÕs brought you,Ó he said 
abruptly. 
Harry merely looked at Slughorn
. SlughornÕs watery eyes slid 
over HarryÕs scar, this
 time taking in th
e rest of his face. 
ÒYou look very like your father.Ó 
ÒYeah, IÕve been told,Ó said Harry. 
ÒExcept for your eyes. YouÕve got ÑÓ 
ÒMy motherÕs eyes, yeah.Ó Harry ha
d heard it so often he found 
it a bit wearing. 
ÒHmpf. Yes, well. You shouldnÕt ha
ve favorites as a teacher, of  
 !#$%&'("")*+("
 -6" course, but she was one of mine. Yo
ur mother,Ó Slughorn added, in 
answer to HarryÕs questioning look. 
ÒLily Evans. One of the bright-
est I ever taught. Vivacious, you kn
ow. Charming girl. I used to tell 
her she ought to have been in 
my House. Very cheeky answers I 
used to get back too.Ó 
ÒWhich was your House?Ó 
ÒI was Head of Slytherin,Ó said
 Slughorn. ÒOh, now,Ó he went 
on quickly, seeing the expression on HarryÕs face and wagging a 
stubby finger at him, ÒdonÕt go 
holding that against me! YouÕll be 
Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes,
 it usually goes in families. Not 
always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done Ñ 
been in the papers for the last couple of years Ñ died a few weeks 
ago ÑÓ 
It was as though an invisible ha
nd had twisted HarryÕs intestines 
and held them tight. 
ÒWell, anyway, he was a big pal of your fatherÕs at school. The 
whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up 
in Gryffindor! Shame Ñ he was a ta
lented boy. I got his brother, 
Regulus, when he came along,
 but IÕd have liked the set.Ó 
He sounded like an enthusiastic
 collector who ha
d been outbid 
at auction. Apparently lost in me
mories, he gazed at the opposite 
wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside. 
ÒYour mother was Muggle-born, of
 course. CouldnÕt believe it 
when I found out. Thought she mu
st have been pure-blood, she 
was so good.Ó 
ÒOne of my best friends is Muggle-born,Ó said Harry, Òand sheÕs 
the best in our year.Ó 
ÒFunny how that sometimes happens, isnÕt it?Ó said Slughorn. 
 #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 -7" ÒNot really,Ó sa
id Harry coldly. 
Slughorn looked down at him in
 surprise. ÒYou mustnÕt think 
IÕm prejudiced!Ó he said. ÒNo, no
, no! HavenÕt I just said your 
mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was 
Dirk Cresswell in the year afte
r her too Ñ now Head of the Gob-
lin Liaison Office, of course Ñ 
another Muggle-born, a very gifted 
student, and still gives me excell
ent inside information on the 
goings-on at Gringotts!Ó 
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, 
and pointed at the many glitteri
ng photograph frames on the 
dresser, each peopled with
 tiny moving occupants. 
ÒAll ex-students, all signed. YouÕll
 notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor 
of the 
Daily Prophet,
 heÕs always interested to hear my take on the 
dayÕs news. And Ambrosius Flum
e, of Honeydukes Ñ a hamper 
every birthday, and all because I wa
s able to give him an introduc-
tion to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the 
back Ñ youÕll see her if you just 
crane your neck Ñ thatÕs Gwenog 
Jones, who of course captains th
e Holyhead Harpies. . . . People 
are always astonished to hear IÕ
m on first-name terms with the 
Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!Ó 
This thought seemed to 
cheer him up enormously. 
ÒAnd all these people know wher
e to find you, to send you 
stuff?Ó asked Harry, who could no
t help wondering why the Death 
Eaters had not yet tracked down Sl
ughorn if hampers of sweets, 
Quidditch tickets, and visitors 
craving his advice and opinions 
could find him. 
The smile slid from SlughornÕs face as quickly as the blood from 
his walls. 
 !#$%&'("")*+("
 -8" ÒOf course not,Ó he said, look
ing down at Harry. ÒI have been 
out of touch with ev
erybody for a year.Ó 
Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn him-
self; he looked quite unsettled 
for a moment. Then he shrugged. 
ÒStill . . . the prudent wizard keep
s his head down in such times. 
All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hog-
warts just now would be tantamount
 to declaring my public alle-
giance to the Order of the Phoenix!
 And while IÕm sure theyÕre very 
admirable and brave and all the rest
 of it, I donÕt 
personally fancy 
the mortality rate ÑÓ 
ÒYou donÕt have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,Ó said 
Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: 
It was hard to sympathize with 
SlughornÕs cosseted existence when 
he remembered Sirius, crouching 
in a cave and living on rats. 
ÒMost of the teachers arenÕt in it
, and none of them has ever been 
killed Ñ well, unless you count Qu
irrell, and he got what he de-
served seeing as he was 
working with Voldemort.Ó 
Harry had been sure Slughorn wo
uld be one of those wizards 
who could not bear to hear Vold
emortÕs name spoken aloud, and 
was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of 
protest, which Harry ignored. 
ÒI reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumble-
doreÕs headmaster; heÕs supposed to 
be the only one Voldemort ever 
feared, isnÕt he?Ó
 Harry went on. 
Slughorn gazed into space for a 
moment or two: He seemed to 
be thinking over
 HarryÕs words. 
ÒWell, yes, it is true that
 He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has 
never sought a fight with Dumbledore,Ó he muttered grudgingly.  
 #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 -9" ÒAnd I suppose one could argue that
 as I have not joined the Death 
Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Nam
ed can hardly count me a 
friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus. 
. . . I cannot pretend that Amel
ia BonesÕs death did not shake 
me. . . . If she, with 
all her Ministry 
contacts and protection . . .Ó 
Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as 
though he had forgotten 
he was in the house. 
ÒOh, there you are, Albus,Ó he 
said. ÒYouÕve been a very long 
time. Upset stomach?Ó 
ÒNo, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,Ó said Dum-
bledore. ÒI do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have tres-
passed upon HoraceÕs hospitality qu
ite long enough; I think it is 
time for us to leave.Ó 
Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry
 jumped to his feet. Slughorn 
seemed taken aback. 
ÒYouÕre leaving?Ó 
ÒYes, indeed. I think I know a 
lost cause when I see one.Ó 
ÒLost. . . ?Ó 
Slughorn seemed agitated. He tw
iddled his fat thumbs and fidg-
eted as he watched Dumbledore fa
sten his traveling cloak, and 
Harry zip up his jacket. 
ÒWell, IÕm sorry you donÕt want th
e job, Horace,Ó said Dumble-
dore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. ÒHogwarts 
would have been glad to see you 
back again. Our greatly increased 
security notwithstanding, you will
 always be welcome to visit, 
should you wish to.Ó 
ÒYes . . . well . . . very gracious . . 
. as I say . . .Ó 
ÒGood-bye, then.Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*+("
 -:" ÒBye,Ó said Harry. 
They were at the front door when 
there was a shout from behind 
them. ÒAll right, all right, IÕll do it!Ó 
Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the 
doorway to the sitting room. 
ÒYou will come ou
t of retirement?Ó 
ÒYes, yes,Ó said Slughorn impatien
tly. ÒI must be mad, but yes.Ó 
ÒWonderful,Ó said Dumbledore, 
beaming. ÒThen, Horace, we 
shall see you on the first of September.Ó 
ÒYes, I daresay you will
,Ó grunted Slughorn. 
As they set off down the garden pa
th, SlughornÕs voice floated af-
ter them, ÒIÕll want a 
pay rise, Dumbledore!Ó 
Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind 
them, and they set off back down th
e hill through the dark and the 
swirling mist. 
ÒWell done, Harry,Ó 
said Dumbledore. 
ÒI didnÕt do anything,Ó 
said Harry in surprise. 
ÒOh yes you did. You showed 
Horace exactly how much he 
stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?Ó 
ÒEr . . .Ó 
Harry wasnÕt sure whether he li
ked Slughorn or not. He sup-
posed he had been pleasant in his wa
y, but he had also seemed vain 
and, whatever he said to the co
ntrary, much too surprised that a 
Muggle-born should make a good witch. 
ÒHorace,Ó said Dumbledore, reli
eving Harry of 
the responsibil-
ity to say any of this, Òlikes his 
comfort. He also likes the company 
of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feel-
ing that he influences these people
. He has never wanted to occupy 
#*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 -," the throne himself; he prefers the ba
ckseat Ñ more room to spread 
out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, some-
times for their ambition or their 
brains, sometimes for their charm 
or their talent, and he had an 
uncanny knack for choosing those 
who would go on to become outs
tanding in their various fields. 
Horace formed a kind of club of 
his favorites with himself at the 
center, making introductions, fo
rging useful contacts between 
members, and always reaping some
 kind of benefit in return, 
whether a free box of 
his favorite crystali
zed pineapple or the 
chance to recommend the next ju
nior member of the Goblin 
Liaison Office.Ó 
Harry had a sudden and vivid ment
al image of a great swollen 
spider, spinning a web around it, 
twitching a thread here and there 
to bring its large and ju
icy flies a little closer. 
ÒI tell you all this,Ó Dumbledor
e continued, Ònot to turn you 
against Horace Ñ or, as we must now call him, Professor Slug-
horn Ñ but to put you on your gu
ard. He will undoubtedly try to 
collect you, Harry. You would be th
e jewel of his collection; Ôthe 
Boy Who LivedÕ . . . or, as they 
call you these days, Ôthe Chosen 
One.ÕÓ 
At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the sur-
rounding mist stole ov
er Harry. He was reminded of words he had 
heard a few weeks ago, words that
 had a horrible and particular 
meaning to him: 
Neither can live whil
e the other survives
 . . . 
Dumbledore had stopped walking, 
level with the church they 
had passed earlier. 
ÒThis will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.Ó 
Braced this time, Harry was read
y for the Apparition, but still 
found it unpleasant. When the pre
ssure disappeared and he found 
!#$%&'("")*+("
 -5" himself able to breathe again, he
 was standing in a country lane 
beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of 
his second favorite buil
ding in the world: the Burrow. In spite of 
the feeling of dread that had just
 swept through him, his spirits 
could not help but lift at the sigh
t of it. Ron was in
 there . . . and 
so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he 
knew. . . . 
ÒIf you donÕt mind, Harry,Ó said
 Dumbledore, as they passed 
through the gate, ÒIÕd like a few wo
rds with you before we part. In 
private. Perhaps in here?Ó 
Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where 
the Weasleys kept their broomst
icks. A little puzzled, Harry fol-
lowed Dumbledore through the creaki
ng door into a space a little 
smaller than the average cupboa
rd. Dumbledore illuminated the 
tip of his wand, so that it glowed
 like a torch, and smiled down at 
Harry. ÒI hope you will forgive me fo
r mentioning it, Harry, but I am 
pleased and a little proud at how we
ll you seem to 
be coping after 
everything that happened at the Mini
stry. Permit me to say that I 
think Sirius would have been proud of you.Ó 
Harry swallowed; his voice seemed 
to have deserted him. He did 
not think he could stand to disc
uss Sirius; it had been painful 
enough to hear Uncle Vernon say 
ÒHis godfatherÕs dead?Ó and even 
worse to hear SiriusÕs name th
rown out casually by Slughorn. 
ÒIt was cruel,Ó said Dumbledore softly, Òthat you and Sirius had 
such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have 
been a long and happy relationship.Ó 
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolu
tely on the spider now climb-
ing DumbledoreÕs hat. He could 
tell that Dumbledore understood, 
#*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 --" that he might even suspect that un
til his letter a
rrived, Harry had 
spent nearly all his time at the Durs
leysÕ lying on his bed, refusing 
meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness 
that he had come to associate with dementors. 
ÒItÕs just hard,Ó Harry said finally,
 in a low voice, Òto realize he 
wonÕt write to me again.Ó 
His eyes burned suddenly and he 
blinked. He felt stupid for ad-
mitting it, but the fact that he 
had had someone outside Hogwarts 
who cared what happened to him, al
most like a parent, had been 
one of the best things about disc
overing his godfather . . . and now 
the post owls would never bring 
him that comfor
t again. . . . 
ÒSirius represented much to you that you had never known 
before,Ó said Dumbledore gently. ÒNaturally, the loss is devastat-
ing. . . .Ó 
ÒBut while I was at the Dursleys
Õ . . .Ó interru
pted Harry, his 
voice growing stronger, ÒI realized 
I canÕt shut myself away or Ñ or 
crack up. Sirius wouldnÕt have wanted that, would he? And anyway, 
lifeÕs too short. . . . Look at
 Madam Bones, look at Emmeline 
Vance. . . . It could be me next, co
uldnÕt it? But if it is,Ó he said 
fiercely, now looking straight into
 DumbledoreÕs blue eyes gleam-
ing in the wandlight, ÒIÕll make su
re I take as many Death Eaters 
with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.Ó 
ÒSpoken both like your mother an
d fatherÕs son and SiriusÕs true 
godson!Ó said Dumbledore, with an
 approving pat on HarryÕs back. 
ÒI take my hat off to you Ñ or I would, if I were not afraid of 
showering you in spiders. 
ÒAnd now, Harry, on a closely rela
ted subject . . . I gather that 
you have been taking the 
Daily Prophet
 over the last two weeks?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster. 
!#$%&'("")*+("
 -3" ÒThen you will have seen 
that there have been
 not so much leaks 
as floods concerning yo
ur adventure in the 
Hall of Prophecy?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry again. ÒAnd 
now everyone knows that IÕm the 
one ÑÓ 
ÒNo, they do not,Ó interrupted 
Dumbledore. ÒThere are only 
two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the 
prophecy made about you and Lord
 Voldemort, and they are both 
standing in this smelly, spidery 
broom shed. It is true, however, 
that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death 
Eaters to steal a prophecy, and th
at the prophecy concerned you. 
ÒNow, I think I am correct in sayi
ng that you have not told any-
body that you know what the prophecy said?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry. 
ÒA wise decision, on the whole,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒAlthough I 
think you ought to relax it in fa
vor of your friends, Mr. Ronald 
Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,Ó he continued, when 
Harry looked startled, ÒI think they
 ought to know. You do them a 
disservice by not confiding some
thing this import
ant to them.Ó 
ÒI didnÕt want ÑÓ 
ÒÑ to worry or frighten them?Ó said Dumbledore, surveying 
Harry over the top of his half-moon
 spectacles. ÒOr perhaps, to 
confess that you yourself are wo
rried and frightened? You need 
your friends, Harry. As you so ri
ghtly said, Sirius would not have 
wanted you to shut yourself away.Ó 
Harry said nothing, but Dumbledo
re did not seem to require an 
answer. He continued, ÒOn a different, though related, subject, it 
is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.Ó 
  #*($!'""./+0#*(1"
 -4" ÒPrivate Ñ with you?Ó said Harry, surprised out of his preoccu-
pied silence. 
ÒYes. I think it is time that I t
ook a greater hand in your educa-
tion.Ó 
ÒWhat will you be teaching me, sir?Ó 
ÒOh, a little of this, a little of 
that,Ó said Dumbledore airily. 
Harry waited hopefully, but Dumb
ledore did not elaborate, so 
he asked something else that ha
d been bothering him slightly. 
ÒIf IÕm having lessons with you,
 I wonÕt have to do Occlumency 
lessons with Snape, will I?Ó 
ÒProfessor 
Snape, Harry Ñ and no, you will not.Ó 
ÒGood,Ó said Harry in relief
, Òbecause they were a ÑÓ 
He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought. 
ÒI think the word ÔfiascoÕ woul
d be a good one here,Ó said Dum-
bledore, nodding. 
Harry laughed. 
ÒWell, that means I wonÕt see much of Professor Snape from now 
on,Ó he said, Òbecause he wonÕt le
t me carry on Potions unless I get 
ÔOutstandingÕ in my O.W.L., which I know I havenÕt.Ó 
ÒDonÕt count your owls before they are delivered,Ó said Dumble-
dore gravely. ÒWhich, now I think of 
it, ought to be some time later 
today. Now, two more things
, Harry, before we part. 
ÒFirstly, I wish you to keep your 
Invisibility Cloak with you at all 
times from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just 
in case, you understand me?Ó 
Harry nodded. 
ÒAnd lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the  
  !#$%&'("")*+("
 36" highest security the Mi
nistry of Magic can provide. These measures 
have caused a certain amount of
 inconvenience to Arthur and 
Molly Ñ all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Min-
istry before being sent on. They 
do not mind in the slightest, for 
their only concern is your safety. 
However, it would be poor repay-
ment if you risked your neck
 while staying 
with them.Ó 
ÒI understand,Ó sa
id Harry quickly. 
ÒVery well, then,Ó said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom 
shed door and stepping out into 
the yard. ÒI see a light in the 
kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly 
any longer of the chance to de-
plore how thin you are.Ó

Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of

uldrons; Harry could hear the 
soft clucking of sleepy chickens 
coming from a distant shed. Dum-
bledore knocked three times an
d Harry saw sudden movement be-
hind the kitchen window. 
ÒWhoÕs there?Ó said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. 
WeasleyÕs. ÒDeclare yourself!Ó 
ÒIt is I, Dumbledore
, bringing Harry.Ó 
The door opened at once. There 
stood Mrs. Weasley, short, 
plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown. 
ÒHarry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not 
to expect you before morning!Ó 
ÒWe were lucky,Ó said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the 
threshold. ÒSlughorn proved much
 more persuadable than I had 
expected. HarryÕs doing, of cour
se. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!Ó 
#"!#$%&'("")*+'"
 ,5" Harry looked around and saw that
 Mrs. Weasley was not alone, 
despite the lateness of the hour. 
A young witch with
 a pale, heart-
shaped face and mousy brown hair 
was sitting at th
e table clutch-
ing a large mug between her hands. 
ÒHello, Professor,Ó she 
said. ÒWotcher, Harry.Ó 
ÒHi, Tonks.Ó 
Harry thought she looked drawn, 
even ill, and there was some-
thing forced in her sm
ile. Certainly her appe
arance was less color-
ful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink 
hair. ÒIÕd better be off,Ó she said quic
kly, standing up and pulling her 
cloak around her shoulders. ÒT
hanks for the tea and sympathy, 
Molly.Ó 
ÒPlease donÕt leave on my account,Ó said Dumbledore courte-
ously, ÒI cannot stay, I have urge
nt matters to discuss with Rufus 
Scrimgeour.Ó 
ÒNo, no, I need to get going,Ó 
said Tonks, not meeting Dum-
bledoreÕs eyes. ÒÕNight ÑÓ 
ÒDear, why not come to dinner
 at the weekend, Remus and 
Mad-Eye are coming Ñ ?Ó 
ÒNo, really, Molly . . . thanks anyway . . . Good night, every-
one. Tonks hurried past Dumbledore an
d Harry into the yard; a few 
paces beyond the doorstep, she tur
ned on the spot and vanished 
into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled. 
ÒWell, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒTake care of yourself. 
Molly, your servant.Ó 
He made Mrs. Weasley a bow an
d followed Tonks, vanishing at 
precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weas
ley closed the door on the empty 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ,6" yard and then steered Harry by the 
shoulders into the full glow of 
the lantern on the table to
 examine his appearance. 
ÒYouÕre like Ron,Ó she sighed, 
looking him up and down. ÒBoth 
of you look as though youÕve had 
Stretching Jinxes put on you. I 
swear RonÕs grown four inches since 
I last bought him school robes. 
Are you hungry, Harry?Ó 
ÒYeah, I am,Ó said Harry, sudd
enly realizing just how hungry he 
was. ÒSit down, dear, IÕll 
knock something up.Ó 
As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face 
jumped onto his knees and 
settled there, purring. 
ÒSo HermioneÕs here?Ó he asked happily as he tickled Crook-
shanks behind the ears. 
ÒOh yes, she arrived the day befo
re yesterday,Ó said Mrs. Weas-
ley, rapping a large iron pot with
 her wand. It bounced onto the 
stove with a loud clang and began to
 bubble at once. ÒEveryoneÕs in 
bed, of course, we di
dnÕt expect you for hours. Here you are ÑÓ 
She tapped the pot again; it rose 
into the air, flew toward Harry, 
and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid 
a bowl neatly beneath it just in 
time to catch the stream of 
thick, steaming onion soup. 
ÒBread, dear?Ó 
ÒThanks, Mrs. Weasley.Ó 
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a 
knife soared gracefully onto the tabl
e; as the loaf sl
iced itself and 
the soup pot dropped back onto 
the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down 
opposite him. 
ÒSo you persuaded Horace Sl
ughorn to take the job?Ó 
Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not 
speak. !#$%&'("")*+'"
 ,7" ÒHe taught Arthur and me,Ó said Mrs. Weasley. ÒHe was at Hog-
warts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I 
think. Did you like him?Ó 
His mouth now full of bread, 
Harry shrugged and gave a non-
committal jerk of the head. 
ÒI know what you mean,Ó said 
Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. 
ÒOf course he can be charming wh
en he wants to be, but ArthurÕs 
never liked him much. The MinistryÕ
s littered with SlughornÕs old 
favorites, he was always good at 
giving leg ups, but he never had 
much time for Arthur Ñ didnÕt seem to think he was enough of a 
highflier. Well, that just shows yo
u, even Slughorn makes mistakes. 
I donÕt know whether RonÕs told you in any of his letters Ñ itÕs only 
just happened Ñ but ArthurÕs been promoted!Ó 
It could not have been clearer th
at Mrs. Weasley had been burst-
ing to say this. 
Harry swallowed a large amount of
 very hot soup and thought he 
could feel his throat blisteri
ng. ÒThatÕs great!Ó he gasped. 
ÒYou are sweet,Ó beamed Mrs. We
asley, possibly taking his wa-
tering eyes for emotion at the new
s. ÒYes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set 
up several new offices in response to the present situation, and 
ArthurÕs heading the Office for th
e Detection and Confiscation of 
Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Prot
ective Objects. ItÕs a big job, 
heÕs got ten people reporting to him now!Ó 
ÒWhat exactly Ñ ?Ó 
ÒWell, you see, in all the 
panic about You-Know-Who, odd 
things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are 
supposed to guard against You-Kn
ow-Who and the Death Eaters. 
You can imagine the kind
 of thing Ñ so-called protective potions 
that are really gravy with a bit of
 bubotuber pus added, or instruc-
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ,8" tions for defensive jinxes that actual
ly make your ears fall off. . . . 
Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus 
Fletcher, whoÕve never done an hones
t dayÕs work in their lives and 
are taking advantage of how frig
htened everybody is, but every 
now and then something really 
nasty turns up. The other day 
Arthur confiscated a box of cursed
 Sneakoscopes that were almost 
certainly planted by a Death Eater. 
So you see, itÕs a very important 
job, and I tell him itÕs just silly 
to miss dealing with spark plugs and 
toasters and all the rest of that
 Muggle rubbish.Ó Mrs. Weasley 
ended her speech with a stern look, 
as if it had been Harry suggest-
ing that it was natura
l to miss spark plugs. 
ÒIs Mr. Weasley still at
 work?Ó Harry asked. 
ÒYes, he is. As a matter of fact, he
Õs a tiny bit late. . . . He said 
heÕd be back around midnight. . . .Ó 
She turned to look at a large 
clock that was pe
rched awkwardly 
on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the 
table. Harry recognized it at on
ce: It had nine hands, each in-
scribed with the name of a fami
ly member, and usually hung on 
the WeasleysÕ sitting room wall, though its current position sug-
gested that Mrs. Weasley had taken 
to carrying it around the house 
with her. Every single one of it
s nine hands was now pointing at 
Òmortal peril.Ó ÒItÕs been like that for a while now,
Ó said Mrs. Weasley, in an un-
convincingly casual voice, Òever since You-Know-Who came back 
into the open. I suppose everybodyÕ
s in mortal danger now. . . . I 
donÕt think it can be just our fami
ly . . . but I donÕt know anyone 
else whoÕs got a clock like th
is, so I canÕt check. Oh!Ó 
With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clockÕs face. Mr. 
WeasleyÕs hand had swit
ched to Òtraveling.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+'"
 ,9" ÒHeÕs coming!Ó 
And sure enough, a moment later 
there was a knock on the back 
door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hu
rried to it; with one hand on 
the doorknob and her face pres
sed against the wood she called 
softly, ÒArthur, is that you?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó came Mr. WeasleyÕs weary voice. ÒBut I would say that 
even if I were a Death Eate
r, dear. Ask the question!Ó 
ÒOh, honestly . . .Ó 
ÒMolly!Ó ÒAll right, all righ
t . . . What is your
 dearest ambition?Ó 
ÒTo find out how airplanes stay up.Ó 
Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned
 the doorknob, but apparently 
Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it
 on the other side, because the 
door remained 
firmly shut. 
ÒMolly! IÕve got to ask you your question first!Ó 
ÒArthur, really, this is
 just silly. . . .Ó 
ÒWhat do you like me to call yo
u when weÕre alone together?Ó 
Even by the dim light of the la
ntern Harry could tell that Mrs. 
Weasley had turned bright red;
 he himself felt suddenly warm 
around the ears and neck, and hast
ily gulped soup, clattering his 
spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl. 
ÒMollywobbles,Ó whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the 
crack at the ed
ge of the door. 
ÒCorrect,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒNow you can let me in.Ó 
Mrs. Weasley opened the door to 
reveal her husband, a thin, 
balding, red-haired wizard wear
ing horn-rimmed spectacles and a 
long and dusty tr
aveling cloak. 
ÒI still donÕt see why we have to go through that every time you 
come home,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ,:" her husband out of his cloak. ÒI
 mean, a Death Eater might have 
forced the answer out of yo
u before impersonating you!Ó 
ÒI know, dear, but itÕs Ministry 
procedure, and I have to set an 
example. Something smells good Ñ onion soup?Ó 
Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in
 the direction of the table. 
ÒHarry! We didnÕt expe
ct you until morning!Ó 
They shook hands, and Mr. Weas
ley dropped into the chair be-
side Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bo
wl of soup in fr
ont of him too. 
ÒThanks, Molly. ItÕs b
een a tough night. Some idiotÕs started sell-
ing Metamorph-Medals. Just slin
g them around your neck and 
youÕll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thou-
sand disguises, all for ten Galleons!Ó 
ÒAnd what really happens when you put them on?Ó 
ÒMostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a cou-
ple of people have also sprouted 
tentaclelike warts all over their 
bodies. As if St. MungoÕs didnÕt
 have enough to do already!Ó 
ÒIt sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find 
funny,Ó said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. ÒAre you sure Ñ ?Ó 
ÒOf course I am!Ó said Mr. Weas
ley. ÒThe boys wouldnÕt do any-
thing like that now, no
t when people are desperate for protection!Ó 
ÒSo is that why youÕre 
late, Metamorph-Medals?Ó 
ÒNo, we got wind of a nasty ba
ckfiring jinx down in Elephant 
and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had 
sorted it out by the time
 we got there. . . .Ó 
Harry stifled a yawn
 behind his hand. 
ÒBed,Ó said an undeceived Mrs. 
Weasley at once. ÒIÕve got Fred 
and GeorgeÕs room all ready for you,
 youÕll have it to yourself.Ó 
ÒWhy, where are they?Ó 
ÒOh, theyÕre in Diagon Alley, sleep
ing in the little flat over their 
!#$%&'("")*+'"
 ,," joke shop as theyÕre so busy,Ó said Mrs. Weasley. ÒI must say, I 
didnÕt approve at first, 
but they do seem to ha
ve a bit of a flair for 
business! Come on, dear, your
 trunkÕs already up there.Ó 
ÒÕNight, Mr. Weasley,Ó said Ha
rry, pushing back his chair. 
Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room. 
ÒGÕnight, Harry,Ó said Mr. Weasley. 
Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance 
at the clock in the washing 
basket as they left the kitchen. 
All the hands were once again at 
Òmortal peril.Ó Fred and GeorgeÕs bedroom was on
 the second floor. Mrs. Weas-
ley pointed her wand at a lamp on
 the bedside table and it ignited 
at once, bathing the room in a 
pleasant golden glow. Though a 
large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small 
window, their perfume could not di
sguise the lingering smell of 
what Harry thought was gunpowde
r. A considerable amount of 
floor space was devoted to a vast 
number of unmarked, sealed card-
board boxes, amongst which stood 
HarryÕs school trunk. The room 
looked as though it was being 
used as a temporary warehouse. 
Hedwig hooted happily at Har
ry from her perch on top of a 
large wardrobe, then took off 
through the window; Harry knew 
she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade 
Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pa
jamas, and got into one of the 
beds. There was something hard in
side the pillowcase. He groped 
inside it and pulled out a sticky 
purple-and-orange sweet, which he 
recognized as a Puking Pastille. Sm
iling to himself, he rolled over 
and was instantly asleep. 
Seconds later, or so it seemed
 to Harry, he wa
s awakened by 
what sounded like cannon fire as
 the door burst op
en. Sitting bolt 
upright, he heard the rasp of th
e curtains being pulled back: The 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ,;" dazzling sunlight seemed to poke 
him hard in both eyes. Shielding 
them with one hand, he groped ho
pelessly for his glasses with the 
other. ÒWuzzgoinon?Ó 
ÒWe didnÕt know you were here al
ready!Ó said a loud and excited 
voice, and he received a sharp 
blow to the top of the head. 
ÒRon, donÕt hit him!Ó said a girlÕs voice reproachfully. 
HarryÕs hand found his glasses an
d he shoved them on, though 
the light was so bright he could 
hardly see anyway. A long, loom-
ing shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and 
Ron Weasley came into focu
s, grinning down at him. 
ÒAll right?Ó 
ÒNever been better,Ó said Harry, 
rubbing the top of his head and 
slumping back onto his pillows. ÒYou?Ó 
ÒNot bad,Ó said Ron, pulling over
 a cardboard box and sitting on 
it. ÒWhen did you get here? MumÕs only just told us!Ó 
ÒAbout one oÕclock this morning.Ó 
ÒWere the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?Ó 
ÒSame as usual,Ó said Harry, as 
Hermione perched herself on the 
edge of his bed, Òthey didnÕt talk 
to me much, but I like it better 
that way. HowÕre you, Hermione?Ó 
ÒOh, IÕm fine,Ó said Hermione, 
who was scrutinizing Harry as 
though he was sickening for somet
hing. He thought he knew what 
was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss SiriusÕs death or 
any other miserable subject at th
e moment, he said, ÒWhatÕs the 
time? Have I missed breakfast?Ó 
ÒDonÕt worry about that, MumÕs bringing you up a tray; she 
reckons you look underfed,Ó said Ro
n, rolling his eyes. ÒSo, whatÕs 
been going on?Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+'"
 ;<" ÒNothing much, IÕve just been 
stuck at my aunt and uncleÕs, 
havenÕt I?Ó 
ÒCome off it!Ó said Ron. ÒYouÕv
e been off with Dumbledore!Ó 
ÒIt wasnÕt that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade 
this old teacher to come out of retirement. His nameÕs Horace 
Slughorn.Ó 
ÒOh,Ó said Ron, looking di
sappointed. ÒWe thought ÑÓ 
Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack 
at top speed. 
ÒÑ we thought itÕd be 
something like that.Ó 
ÒYou did?Ó said Harry, amused. 
ÒYeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new 
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, donÕt we? So, er, whatÕs he 
like?Ó 
ÒHe looks a bit like a walrus, 
and he used to be Head of 
Slytherin,Ó said Harry. ÒSom
ething wrong, Hermione?Ó 
She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to 
manifest themselves at any mom
ent. She rearranged her features 
hastily in an unco
nvincing smile. 
ÒNo, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like heÕll be a 
good teacher?Ó 
ÒDunno,Ó said Harry. ÒHe canÕt 
be worse than Umbridge, can 
he?Ó 
ÒI know someone whoÕs worse than Umbridge,Ó said a voice 
from the doorway. RonÕs younger si
ster slouched into the room, 
looking irritable. ÒHi, Harry.Ó 
ÒWhatÕs up with 
you?Ó Ron asked. 
ÒItÕs her,Ó said Ginny, plonking herself down on HarryÕs bed. 
ÒSheÕs driving me mad.Ó 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ;-" ÒWhatÕs she done now?Ó asked Hermione sympathetically. 
ÒItÕs the way she talks to me Ñ 
youÕd think I was about three!Ó 
ÒI know,Ó said Hermione, dropping her voice. ÒSheÕs so full of 
herself.Ó 
Harry was astonished to hear 
Hermione talking about Mrs. 
Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, 
ÒCanÕt you two lay off 
her for five seconds?Ó 
ÒOh, thatÕs right, defend her,
Ó snapped Ginny. ÒWe all know you 
canÕt get enough of her.Ó 
This seemed an odd comment to make about RonÕs mother. 
Starting to feel that he was mi
ssing something, Harry said, ÒWho 
are you Ñ ?Ó 
But his question was answered b
efore he could finish it. The 
bedroom door flew open again, an
d Harry instinctiv
ely yanked the 
bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off 
the bed onto the floor. 
A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such 
breathtaking beauty that the room 
seemed to have become strangely 
airless. She was tall and willowy wi
th long blonde ha
ir and appeared 
to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To
 complete this vision of perfec-
tion, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray. 
ÒÕArry,Ó she said in a throaty vo
ice. ÒEet Õas been too long!Ó 
As she swept over the threshol
d toward him, Mrs. Weasley was 
revealed, bobbing along in her 
wake, looking rather cross. 
ÒThere was no need to
 bring up the tray, I 
was just about to do 
it myself!Ó 
ÒEet was no trouble,Ó said Fleur 
Delacour, setting the tray across 
HarryÕs knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt 
the places where her mouth had touched him burn. ÒI Õave been 
!#$%&'("")*+'"
 ;5" longing to see Õim. You remember 
my seester, Gabrielle? She never 
stops talking about ÕArry Potter. Sh
e will be delighted to see you 
again.Ó ÒOh . . . is she here 
too?Ó Harry croaked. 
ÒNo, no, silly boy,Ó said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, ÒI mean 
next summer, when we Ñ 
but do you not know?Ó 
Her great blue eyes widened an
d she looked reproachfully at 
Mrs. Weasley, who said, ÒWe hadnÕt got around to telling him yet.Ó 
Fleur turned back to Harry, swingi
ng her silvery sheet of hair so 
that it whipped Mrs. 
Weasley across the face. 
ÒBill and I are going to be married!Ó 
ÒOh,Ó said Harry blankly. He coul
d not help noticing how Mrs. 
Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were
 all determinedly avoiding one 
anotherÕs gaze. ÒWow. Er Ñ congratulations!Ó 
She swooped down upon him 
and kissed him again. 
ÒBill is very busy at ze moment
, working very Õard, and I only 
work part-time at Gringotts for my 
Eenglish, so he brought me Õere 
for a few days to get to know Õis fa
mily properly. I was so pleased to 
Õear you would be coming Ñ zere isnÕt much to do Õere, unless you 
like cooking and chickens! Well 
Ñ enjoy your brea
kfast, ÕArry!Ó 
With these words she turned grac
efully and seemed to float out 
of the room, closing the 
door quietly behind her. 
Mrs. Weasley made a noise th
at sounded li
ke Òtchah!Ó 
ÒMum hates her,Ó said Ginny quietly. 
ÒI do not hate her!Ó said Mrs. Weas
ley in a cross whisper. ÒI just 
think theyÕve hurried into th
is engagement, thatÕs all!Ó 
ÒTheyÕve known each other a year
,Ó said Ron, who looked oddly 
groggy and was starin
g at the closed door. 
ÒWell, thatÕs not very long! I kn
ow why itÕs happened, of course. 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ;6" ItÕs all this uncertainty with Yo
u-Know-Who coming back, people 
think they might be dead tomorrow
, so theyÕre rushing all sorts of 
decisions theyÕd normally take time over. It was the same last time 
he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center ÑÓ 
ÒIncluding you and Dad,Ó said Ginny slyly. 
ÒYes, well, your father and I were
 made for each other, what was 
the point in waiting?Ó 
said Mrs. Weasley. ÒW
hereas Bill and Fleur 
. . . well . . . what have they really got in common? HeÕs a hard-
working, down-to-earth sort 
of person, whereas sheÕs ÑÓ 
ÒA cow,Ó said Ginny, nodding. ÒB
ut BillÕs not that down-to-
earth. HeÕs a Curse-Breaker, isnÕt 
he, he likes a bit of adventure, a 
bit of glamour. . . . I expect thatÕs why heÕs gone for Phlegm.Ó 
ÒStop calling her that, Ginny,Ó sa
id Mrs. Weasley sharply, as 
Harry and Hermione laughed. ÒWel
l, IÕd better get on. . . . Eat 
your eggs while th
eyÕre warm, Harry.Ó 
Looking careworn, she left the ro
om. Ron still seemed slightly 
punch-drunk; he was shaking his 
head experimentally like a dog 
trying to rid its ears of water. 
ÒDonÕt you get used to her if sh
eÕs staying in the same house?Ó 
Harry asked. 
ÒWell, you do,Ó said Ron, Òbut if she jumps out at you unex-
pectedly, like then . . .Ó 
ÒItÕs pathetic,Ó said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron 
as far as she could go and turning 
to face him with her arms folded 
once she had re
ached the wall. 
ÒYou donÕt really want her ar
ound forever?Ó Ginny asked Ron 
incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, ÒWell, MumÕs 
going to put a stop to it if 
she can, I bet you anything.Ó 
ÒHowÕs she going to manage that?Ó asked Harry. 
!#$%&'("")*+'"
 ;7" ÒShe keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think sheÕs 
hoping Bill will fall for Tonks inst
ead. I hope he does, IÕd much 
rather have her in the family.Ó 
ÒYeah, thatÕll work,Ó said Ron sarc
astically. ÒList
en, no bloke in 
his right mindÕs going to fancy Tonks when FleurÕs around. I mean, 
Tonks is okay-looking when she isnÕ
t doing stupid things to her 
hair and her nose, but ÑÓ 
ÒSheÕs a damn sight nicer than 
Phlegm,
ÕÕ said Ginny 
ÒAnd sheÕs more intelligent, sheÕs 
an Auror!Ó said Hermione from 
the corner. 
ÒFleurÕs not stupid, she was g
ood enough to enter the Triwizard 
Tournament,Ó said Harry. 
ÒNot you as well!Ó said Hermione bitterly. 
ÒI suppose you like the way Phle
gm says ÔÕArry,Õ do you?Ó asked 
Ginny scornfully. 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry, wishing he hadn
Õt spoken, ÒI was just saying, 
Phlegm Ñ I mean, Fleur ÑÓ 
ÒIÕd much rather have Tonks in the family,Ó said Ginny. ÒAt least 
sheÕs a laugh.Ó 
ÒShe hasnÕt been much of a laugh lately,Ó said Ron. ÒEvery time 
IÕve seen her sheÕs looked more like Moaning Myrtle.Ó 
ÒThatÕs not fair,Ó snapped Hermio
ne. ÒShe still hasnÕt got over 
what happened . . . you know . 
. . I mean, he wa
s her cousin!Ó 
HarryÕs heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a 
fork and began shovelin
g scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to 
deflect any invitation to join in
 this part of the conversation. 
ÒTonks and Sirius barely knew each other!Ó said Ron. ÒSirius was 
in Azkaban half her life and before
 that their families never met ÑÓ 
 $.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ;8" ÒThatÕs not the point,Ó said Herm
ione. ÒShe thinks it was her 
fault he died!Ó 
ÒHow does she work that one ou
t?Ó asked Harry, in spite of 
himself. 
ÒWell, she was fighting Bellatrix 
Lestrange, wasnÕt she? I think 
she feels that if only she had finished
 her off, Bellatrix couldnÕt have 
killed Sirius.Ó 
ÒThatÕs stupid,Ó said Ron. 
ÒItÕs survivorÕs guilt,Ó said Hermione. ÒI know LupinÕs tried to 
talk her round, but sheÕs still really down. SheÕs actually having 
trouble with her Metamorphosing!Ó 
ÒWith her Ñ ?Ó 
ÒShe canÕt change her appearance
 like she used to,Ó explained 
Hermione. ÒI think her powers must
 have been affected by shock, 
or something.Ó 
ÒI didnÕt know that coul
d happen,Ó said Harry. 
ÒNor did I,Ó said Hermione, Òbut I suppose if youÕre really de-
pressed . . .Ó 
The door opened again and Mrs. 
Weasley popped her head in. 
ÒGinny,Ó she whispered, Òcome dow
nstairs and help me with the 
lunch.Ó 
ÒIÕm talking to this lot!Ó said Ginny, outraged. 
ÒNow!Ó said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew. ÒShe only wants me there so she 
doesnÕt have to be alone with 
Phlegm!Ó said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around 
in a very good imitation of Fleur 
and pranced across the room with 
her arms held aloft like a ballerina. 
ÒYou lot had better co
me down quickly too,Ó sh
e said as she left.

 ;9" Harry took advantage of the te
mporary silence to eat more 
breakfast. Hermione was peering 
into Fred and GeorgeÕs boxes, 
though every now and then she cast
 sideways looks at Harry. Ron, 
who was now helping himself to HarryÕs toast, was still gazing 
dreamily at the door. 
ÒWhatÕs this?Ó Hermione asked 
eventually, holding up what 
looked like a small telescope. 
ÒDunno,Ó said Ron, Òbut if Fred 
and GeorgeÕve left it here, itÕs 
probably not ready for the joke
 shop yet, so be careful.Ó ÒYour mum said the sh
opÕs going well,Ó said Harry. ÒSaid Fred 
and George have got a real flair for business.Ó 
ÒThatÕs an understatement,Ó said
 Ron. ÒTheyÕre raking in the 
Galleons! I canÕt wait to see the pl
ace, we havenÕt been to Diagon 
Alley yet, because Mum says DadÕs got to be there for extra security 
and heÕs been really busy at 
work, but it soun
ds excellent.Ó 
ÒAnd what about Percy?Ó asked 
Harry; the third-eldest Weasley 
brother had fallen out with the rest 
of the family. ÒIs he talking to 
your mum and dad again?Ó 
ÒNope,Ó said Ron. 
ÒBut he knows your dad was ri
ght all along now about Volde-
mort being back ÑÓ 
ÒDumbledore says people find it 
far easier to forgive others for 
being wrong than being right,Ó 
said Hermione. ÒI heard him 
telling your mum, Ron.Ó 
ÒSounds like the sort of ment
al thing Dumbledore would say,Ó 
said Ron. 
ÒHeÕs going to be giving me private lessons this year,Ó said Harry 
conversationally. 
 $.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ;:" Ron choked on his bit of to
ast, and Hermione gasped. 
ÒYou kept that quiet!Ó said Ron. 
ÒI only just remembered,Ó said Harry honestly. ÒHe told me last 
night in your broom shed.Ó 
ÒBlimey . . . private lessons with
 Dumbledore!Ó said Ron, look-
ing impressed. ÒI wond
er why heÕs . . . ?Ó 
His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange 
looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather 
fast considering that all he was 
doing was sitting in bed. Dumble-
dore had said to do it. . . . Why no
t now? He fixed his eyes on his 
fork, which was gleaming
 in the sunlight stre
aming into his lap, 
and said, ÒI donÕt know exactly wh
y heÕs going to be giving me 
lessons, but I think it
 must be because of the prophecy.Ó 
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression 
that both had frozen. He continued,
 still speaking to his fork, ÒYou 
know, the one they were trying
 to steal at the Ministry.Ó 
ÒNobody knows what it said, thou
gh,Ó said Hermione quickly. 
ÒIt got smashed.Ó 
ÒAlthough the 
Prophet
 says ÑÓ began Ron,
 but Hermione said, 
ÒShh!Ó 
ÒThe ProphetÕs
 got it right,Ó said Harry, 
looking up at them both 
with a great effort: Hermione seem
ed frightened and Ron amazed. 
ÒThat glass ball that smashed wa
snÕt the only record of the 
prophecy. I heard the whole thing 
in DumbledoreÕs office, he was 
the one the prophecy was made to, 
so he could tell me. From what 
it said,Ó Harry took a deep breath
, Òit looks like IÕm the one whoÕs 
got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At 
least, it said neither of us could 
live while the other survives.Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*+'"
 ;," The three of them gazed at one 
another in silence for a moment. 
Then there was a loud bang and 
Hermione vanished behind a puff 
of black smoke. 
ÒHermione!Ó shouted Harry and Ron;
 the breakfast 
tray slid to 
the floor with a crash. 
Hermione emerged, coughing, ou
t of the smoke, clutching the 
telescope and sporting a bril
liantly purple black eye. 
ÒI squeezed it and it Ñ it
 punched me!Ó she gasped. 
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring pro-
truding from the end of the telescope. 
ÒDonÕt worry,Ó said Ron, who wa
s plainly trying not to laugh, 
ÒMumÕll fix that, sheÕs good at
 healing minor injuries ÑÓ 
ÒOh well, never mind that now!Ó 
said Hermione hastily. ÒHarry, 
oh, Harry . . .Ó 
She sat down on the edge
 of his bed again. 
ÒWe wondered, after we got back 
from the Ministry . . . Obvi-
ously, we didnÕt want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius 
Malfoy said about the prophecy, 
how it was about you and Volde-
mort, well, we thought it might be
 something like this. . . . Oh, 
Harry . . .Ó She stared at him, then whispered, ÒAre you scared?Ó 
ÒNot as much as I was,Ó said Ha
rry. ÒWhen I first heard it, I was 
. . . but now, it seems as though I always knew IÕd have to face him 
in the end. . . .Ó 
ÒWhen we heard Dumbledore was co
llecting you in person, we 
thought he might be telling you 
something or showing you some-
thing to do with the prophecy,Ó sa
id Ron eagerly. ÒAnd we were 
kind of right, werenÕt we? He wouldnÕt be giving you lessons if he 
thought you were a goner, wouldnÕt waste his time Ñ he must 
think youÕve got a chance!Ó 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" ;;" ÒThatÕs true,Ó said Hermione. ÒI
 wonder what heÕll teach you, 
Harry? Really advanced defensive ma
gic, probably . . . powerful 
countercurses . . . 
anti-jinxes . . .Ó 
Harry did not really 
listen. A warmth wa
s spreading through 
him that had nothing to do with 
the sunlight; a tight obstruction 
in his chest seemed to be disso
lving. He knew that Ron and 
Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the 
mere fact that they were still ther
e on either side of him, speaking 
bracing words of comfort, not sh
rinking from him as though he 
were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could 
ever tell them. 
Ò. . . and evasive enchantments generally,Ó concluded Hermi-
one. ÒWell, at least you know one lesson youÕll be having this year, 
thatÕs one more than Ron and me
. I wonder when our O.W.L. re-
sults will come?Ó 
ÒCanÕt be long now, itÕs been a month,Ó said Ron. 
ÒHang on,Ó said Harry, as anothe
r part of last nightÕs conver-
sation came back to him. ÒI th
ink Dumbledore said our O.W.L. 
results would be arriving today!Ó 
ÒToday?Ó shrieked Hermione. Ò
Today
? But why didnÕt you Ñ oh 
my God Ñ you should have said ÑÓ 
She leapt to
 her feet. 
ÒIÕm going to see whether an
y owls have come. . . .Ó 
But when Harry arrived downstair
s ten minutes later, fully 
dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find 
Hermione sitting at the kitchen tabl
e in great agitation, while Mrs. 
Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda. 
ÒIt just wonÕt budge,Ó Mrs. Weas
ley was saying an
xiously, stand-
ing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of 
The !#$%&'("")*+'"
 -<<" HealerÕs Helpmate
 open at ÒBruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.Ó ÒThis 
has always worked before, I just canÕt understand it.Ó 
ÒItÕll be Fred and GeorgeÕs idea of a funny joke, making sure it 
canÕt come off,Ó said Ginny 
ÒBut itÕs got to come off!Ó squeaked Hermione. ÒI canÕt go 
around looking like this forever!Ó 
ÒYou wonÕt, dear, weÕll find an 
antidote, donÕt worry,Ó said Mrs. 
Weasley soothingly. 
ÒBill told me Õow Fred and George
 are very amusing!Ó said Fleur, 
smiling serenely. 
ÒYes, I can hardly breathe for 
laughing,Ó snapped Hermione. 
She jumped up and started walking round and round the 
kitchen, twisting her fingers together. 
ÒMrs. Weasley, youÕre quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this 
morning?Ó 
ÒYes, dear, IÕd have noticed,Ó said Mrs. Weasley patiently. ÒBut 
itÕs barely nine, thereÕs st
ill plenty of time. . . .Ó 
ÒI know I messed up Ancient Runes,Ó muttered Hermione 
feverishly, ÒI definitely made at
 least one serious mistranslation. 
And the Defense Against the Dark Arts
 practical was no good at all. 
I thought Transfiguration went a
ll right at the time, but looking 
back ÑÓ 
ÒHermione, will you shut up, youÕre not the only one whoÕs 
nervous!Ó barked Ron. ÒAnd when youÕve got your eleven ÔOut-
standingÕ O.W.L.s . . .Ó 
ÒDonÕt, donÕt, donÕt!Ó 
said Hermione, flapping her hands hyster-
ically. ÒI know IÕve failed everything!Ó 
ÒWhat happens if we fail?Ó Harry as
ked the room at large, but it 
was again Hermione
 who answered. 
$.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" -<-" ÒWe discuss our options with ou
r Head of House, I asked Pro-
fessor McGonagall at th
e end of last term.Ó 
HarryÕs stomach squirmed. He 
wished he had eaten less 
breakfast. 
ÒAt Beauxbatons,Ó said Fleur co
mplacently, Òwe Õad a different 
way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examina-
tions after six years of study, not five, and then ÑÓ 
FleurÕs words were drowned in 
a scream. Hermione was pointing 
through the kitchen window. Three 
black specks were clearly visi-
ble in the sky, growin
g larger all the time. 
ÒTheyÕre definitely owls,Ó said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join 
Hermione at the window. 
ÒAnd there are three of them,Ó sa
id Harry, hastening to her other 
side. 
ÒOne for each of us,Ó said Hermione in a terrified whisper. ÒOh 
no . . . oh no . . . oh no . . .Ó 
She gripped both Harry and Ro
n tightly around the elbows. 
The owls were flying directly 
at the Burrow, three handsome 
tawnies, each of which, it became 
clear as they flew lower over the 
path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope. 
ÒOh no!Ó squealed Hermione. 
Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen win-
dow. One, two, three, the owls soar
ed through it and landed on the 
table in a neat line. 
All three of them lift
ed their right legs. 
Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to 
the leg of the owl in 
the middle. He untied 
it with fumbling fin-
gers. To his left, Ron was trying 
to detach his own results; to his 
right, HermioneÕs hands were shak
ing so much she was making her 
whole owl tremble. 
!#$%&'("")*+'"
 -<5" Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach 
the envelope. He slit it open qu
ickly and unfolded the parchment 
inside.

 Harry read the parchment through 
several times, his breathing 
becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always 
known that he would fail Divinati
on, and he had had no chance of 
passing History of Magic, given 
that he had collapsed halfway 
through the examination,
 but he had passed everything else! He ran 
his finger down the grades . . . he had passed well in Transfiguration  
 $.""'/!'00""1)""%#2'34" -<6" and Herbology, he had even exceeded
 expectations at Potions! And 
best of all, he had achieved ÒO
utstandingÓ at Defense Against the 
Dark Arts! He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head 
bent, but Ron was lo
oking delighted. 
ÒOnly failed Divination and Hi
story of Magic, and who cares 
about them?Ó he said happily 
to Harry. ÒHere Ñ swap ÑÓ 
Harry glanced down RonÕs grades
: There were no ÒOutstand-
ingsÓ there. . . . 
ÒKnew youÕd be top at Defense 
Against the Dark Arts,Ó said 
Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. ÒWeÕve done all right, 
havenÕt we?Ó 
ÒWell done!Ó said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling RonÕs hair. 
ÒSeven O.W.L.s, thatÕs more than
 Fred and George got together!Ó 
ÒHermione?Ó said Ginny tentativ
ely, for Hermione still hadnÕt 
turned around. ÒH
ow did you do?Ó 
ÒI Ñ not bad,Ó said Hermione in a small voice. 
ÒOh, come off it,Ó said Ron, st
riding over to her and whipping 
her results out of her hand. ÒYep
 Ñ nine ÔOutstandingsÕ and one 
ÔExceeds ExpectationsÕ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.Ó He 
looked down at her, half-amused, 
half-exasperated. ÒYouÕre actually 
disappointed, arenÕt you?Ó 
Hermione shook her head
, but Harry laughed. 
ÒWell, weÕre N.E.W.T. students 
now!Ó grinned Ron. ÒMum, are 
there any more sausages?Ó 
Harry looked back down at his resu
lts. They were as good as he 
could have hoped for. He felt just 
one tiny twinge of regret. . . . 
This was the end of his ambition to
 become an Auror. He had not  
 !#$%&'("")*+'"
 -<7" secured the required Potions grade.
 He had known all along that he 
wouldnÕt, but he still felt a sinkin
g in his stomach as he looked 
again at that small black E. 
It was odd, really, seeing that it
 had been a Death Eater in dis-
guise who had first told Harry he
 would make a good Auror, but 
somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldnÕt really 
think of anything else he would li
ke to be. Moreover, it had seemed 
the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few 
weeks ago. . . . 
Neither can live while the other survives.
 . . . WouldnÕt 
he be living up to the prophecy, 
and giving himself the best chance 
of survival, if he joined those hi
ghly trained wizards whose job it 
was to find and 
kill Voldemort?

   arry remained within the conf
ines of the BurrowÕs gar-
den over the next few weeks. 
He spent most of his days 
playing two-a-side Quidditch in
 the WeasleysÕ orchard (he and 
Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and 
Ginny good, so they were reason
ably well matched) and his eve-
nings eating triple helpings of ev
erything Mrs. Weasley put in front 
of him. It would have been a happy, peacef
ul holiday had it not been for 
the stories of disappearances, odd 
accidents, even of deaths now 
appearing almost daily in the 
Prophet.
 Sometimes Bill and Mr. 
Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To 
Mrs. WeasleyÕs displeasure, HarryÕs
 sixteenth birthday celebrations 
were marred by grisly tidings 
brought to the party by Remus 
Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked 
liberally with gray, his clothes mo
re ragged and patched than ever. 
ÒThere have been another couple
 of dementor attacks,Ó he 
#"!#$%&'("")*+"
 ,-3" announced, as Mrs. Weasley passe
d him a large slice of birthday 
cake. ÒAnd theyÕve found Igor KarkaroffÕs body in a shack up 
north. The Dark Mark had been set over it Ñ well, frankly, IÕm 
surprised he stayed alive for even
 a year after deserting the Death 
Eaters; SiriusÕs brother, Regulus, 
only managed a few days as far as 
I can remember.Ó 
ÒYes, well,Ó said Mrs. Weasley,
 frowning, Òperhaps we should 
talk about something diff ÑÓ 
ÒDid you hear about Florean Fo
rtescue, Remus?Ó asked Bill, 
who was being plied with wine by Fleur. ÒThe man who ran ÑÓ 
ÒÑ the ice-cream place in Diag
on Alley?Ó Harry interrupted, 
with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. ÒHe 
used to give me free ice crea
ms. WhatÕs happ
ened to him?Ó 
ÒDragged off, by the look of his place.Ó 
ÒWhy?Ó asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill. 
ÒWho knows? He mustÕve upset them somehow. He was a good 
man, Florean.Ó 
ÒTalking of Diagon Alley,Ó said
 Mr. Weasley, Òlooks like Olli-
vanderÕs gone too.Ó 
ÒThe wandmaker?Ó said Gi
nny, looking startled. 
ÒThatÕs the one. ShopÕs empty. No sign of a struggle. No one 
knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.Ó 
ÒBut wands Ñ whatÕll people do for wands?Ó 
ÒTheyÕll make do with other makers
,Ó said Lupin. ÒBut Ollivan-
der was the best, and if the other side have got him itÕs not so good 
for us.Ó 
The day after this rather gloomy 
birthday tea, their letters and 
booklists arrived from Hogwarts. 
HarryÕs included a surprise: He 
had been made Quidditch Captain. 
/($!01)""/'&02("
 ,-4" ÒThat gives you equal status with prefects!Ó cried Hermione 
happily. ÒYou can use our specia
l bathroom now and everything!Ó 
ÒWow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,Ó said Ron, 
examining the badge with glee. ÒHa
rry, this is so cool, youÕre my 
Captain Ñ if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .Ó 
ÒWell, I donÕt suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley 
much longer now youÕve got these,Ó sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking 
down RonÕs booklist. ÒWeÕll go on Sa
turday as long as your father 
doesnÕt have to go into work again. IÕm not going there without 
him.Ó 
ÒMum, dÕyou honestly think You-
Know-WhoÕs going to be hid-
ing behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?Ó sniggered Ron. 
ÒFortescue and Ollivander went on
 holiday, did they?Ó said Mrs. 
Weasley, firing up at once. ÒIf yo
u think securityÕs
 a laughing mat-
ter you can stay behi
nd and IÕll get your
 things myself ÑÓ 
ÒNo, I wanna come, I want to see 
Fred and GeorgeÕs shop!Ó said 
Ron hastily. 
ÒThen you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide 
youÕre too immature to come with 
us!Ó said Mrs. Weasley angrily, 
snatching up her clock, all nine ha
nds of which were still pointing 
at Òmortal peril,Ó and balancing it on
 top of a pile of just-laundered 
towels. ÒAnd that goes for retu
rning to Hogwarts as well!Ó 
Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted 
the laundry basket and the teet
ering clock into her arms and 
stormed out of the room. 
ÒBlimey . . . you canÕt even make a 
joke round here anymore. . . .Ó 
But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the 
next few days. Saturday dawned wi
thout any more outbursts from 
Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed 
very tense at breakfast. Bill, who 
!#$%&'("")*+"
 ,-5" would be staying at home with
 Fleur (much to Hermione and 
GinnyÕs pleasure), passed a full mo
ney bag across the table to Harry. 
ÒWhereÕs mine?Ó demanded Ro
n at once, his eyes wide. 
ÒThatÕs already HarryÕs, idiot,Ó sa
id Bill. ÒI got it out of your 
vault for you, Harry, because itÕs 
taking about five hours for the 
public to get to thei
r gold at the moment, 
the goblins have tight-
ened security so much. Two days 
ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity 
Probe stuck up his . 
. . Well, trust me, th
is wayÕs easier.Ó 
ÒThanks, Bill,Ó said Harry, pocketing his gold. 
ÒÕE is always so thoughtful,Ó purred Fleur adoringly, stroking 
BillÕs nose. Ginny mimed vomiting 
into her cereal behind Fleur. 
Harry choked over his cornflakes
, and Ron thumped him on the 
back. It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of 
Magic cars, in which Harry had ri
dden once before, was awaiting 
them in the front yard when they 
emerged from the house, pulling 
on their cloaks. 
ÒItÕs good Dad can get us these ag
ain,Ó said Ron 
appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the ca
r moved smoothly away from the 
Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving 
from the kitchen window. He, 
Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in 
the wide backseat. 
ÒDonÕt get used to it, itÕs only because of Harry,Ó said Mr. Weas-
ley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the 
Ministry driver; the front passenger
 seat had obligi
ngly stretched 
into what resembled a two-seater
 sofa. ÒHeÕs been given top-grade 
security status. And weÕll be joining up with additional security at 
the Leaky Cauldron too.Ó 
Harry said nothing; he did not 
much fancy doing his shopping 
/($!01)""/'&02("
 ,-6" while surrounded by a battalion 
of Aurors. He had stowed his 
Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good 
enough for Dumbledore, it ought 
to be good enough for the Min-
istry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the 
Ministry knew about his cloak. 
ÒHere you are, then,Ó said the dr
iver, a surprisingly short while 
later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross 
Road and stopped outside the Leak
y Cauldron. ÒIÕm to wait for 
you, any idea how long youÕll be?Ó 
ÒA couple of hours, I expect,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒAh, good, heÕs 
here!Ó 
Harry imitated Mr. 
Weasley and peered 
through the window; 
his heart leapt. There were no Au
rors waiting outside the inn, but 
instead the gigantic, black-bearde
d form of Rubeus Hagrid, the 
Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at 
the sight of HarryÕs face and oblivious to the startled stares of pass-
ing Muggles. 
ÒHarry!Ó he boomed, sweeping 
Harry into a bone-crushing hug 
the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. ÒBuckbeak Ñ 
Witherwings, I mean Ñ yeh should
 see him, Harry, heÕs so happy 
ter be back in the open air ÑÓ 
ÒGlad heÕs pleased,Ó said Harry, gr
inning as he massaged his ribs. 
ÒWe didnÕt know ÔsecurityÕ meant you!Ó 
ÒI know, jusÕ like old times, inni
t? See, the Ministry wanted ter 
send a bunch oÕ Aurors, but Dumbledore said IÕd do,Ó said Hagrid 
proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his 
pockets. ÒLetÕs get goinÕ then 
Ñ after yeh, Molly, Arthur ÑÓ 
The Leaky Cauldron wa
s, for the first time
 in HarryÕs memory, 
completely empty. Only
 Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless,

ooked up hopefully as they en-
tered, but before he could speak,
 Hagrid said importantly, ÒJusÕ 
passinÕ through today, Tom, sure
 yeh understand, Hogwarts busi-
ness, yeh know.Ó 
Tom nodded gloomily and returned
 to wiping glasses; Harry, 
Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and 
out into the chilly little courtyar
d at the back where the dustbins 
stood. Hagrid raised hi
s pink umbrella and ra
pped a certain brick 
in the wall, which opened at once 
to form an archway onto a wind-
ing cobbled street. They stepped 
through the entrance and paused, 
looking around. 
Diagon Alley had changed. The co
lorful, glittering window dis-
plays of spellbooks, potion ingredi
ents, and cauldrons were lost to 
view, hidden behind the large Mini
stry of Magic posters that had 
been pasted over them. Most of th
ese somber purple posters carried 
blown-up versions of the securi
ty advice on the Ministry pam-
phlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore 
moving black-and-white photograph
s of Death Eaters known to be 
on the loose. Bellatrix 
Lestrange was sneering 
from the front of the 
nearest apothecary. A few window
s were boarded up, including 
those of Florean FortescueÕs Ice 
Cream Parlor. On the other hand, 
a number of shabby-looking stalls 
had sprung up along the street. 
The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and 
Blotts, under a striped, staine
d awning, had a cardboard sign 
pinned to its front: 
 AMULETS Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi 
/($!01)""/'&02("
 ,,," A seedy-looking little wizard was 
rattling armfuls of silver sym-
bols on chains at passersby. 
ÒOne for your little girl, madam?
Ó he called at Mrs. Weasley as 
they passed, leering at Ginny.
 ÒProtect her pretty neck?Ó 
ÒIf I were on duty . . .Ó said Mr
. Weasley, glaring angrily at the 
amulet seller. 
ÒYes, but donÕt go arresting anyo
ne now, dear, weÕre in a hurry,Ó 
said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consu
lting a list. ÒI think weÕd better 
do Madam MalkinÕs first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and 
RonÕs showing much too much ankl
e in his school robes, and you 
must need new ones too, Harry, 
youÕve grown so much Ñ come 
on, everyone ÑÓ 
ÒMolly, it doesnÕt make sense for all of us to go to Madam Mal-
kinÕs,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒWhy don
Õt those three go with Hagrid, 
and we can go to Flourish and Bl
otts and get everyoneÕs school-
books?Ó 
ÒI donÕt know,Ó said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn be-
tween a desire to finish the shoppi
ng quickly and the wish to stick 
together in a pack. ÒHag
rid, do you think Ñ ?Ó 
ÒDonÕ fret, theyÕll be fine with 
me, Molly,Ó said Hagrid sooth-
ingly, waving an airy hand the si
ze of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley 
did not look entirely convinced, 
but allowed the separation, scur-
rying off toward Flourish and Bl
otts with her husband and Ginny 
while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam 
MalkinÕs. Harry noticed that many of the pe
ople who passed them had the 
same harried, anxious look as Mrs.
 Weasley, and that nobody was 
stopping to talk 
anymore; the shoppers stay
ed together in their  
 !#$%&'("")*+"
 ,,7" own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. No-
body seemed to be
 shopping alone. 
ÒMighÕ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,Ó said Hagrid, 
stopping outside Madam Malkin
Õs and bending down to peer 
through the window. ÒIÕll stan
d guard outside,
 all right?Ó So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entere
d the little shop together. It 
appeared, at first glance, to be 
empty, but no sooner had the door 
swung shut behind them than they
 heard a familiar voice issuing 
from behind a rack of dress ro
bes in spangled green and blue. 
Ò. . . not a child, in case you havenÕt noticed, Mother. I am per-
fectly capable of 
doing my shopping 
alone.Ó There was a clucking noise and a 
voice Harry recognized as that 
of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, ÒNow, dear, your motherÕs 
quite right, none of us is suppose
d to go wandering around on our 
own anymore, itÕs nothing to
 do with being a child ÑÓ 
ÒWatch where youÕre sticki
ng that pin, will you!Ó 
A teenage boy with a pale, pointe
d face and white-blond hair ap-
peared from behind the rack, wear
ing a handsome set of dark green 
robes that glittered with pins ar
ound the hem and the edges of the 
sleeves. He strode to the mirror an
d examined himself; it was a few 
moments before he noticed Harry
, Ron, and Hermione reflected 
over his shoulder. His li
ght gray eyes narrowed. 
ÒIf youÕre wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just 
walked in,Ó said Draco Malfoy. 
ÒI donÕt think thereÕs any need fo
r language like that!Ó said 
Madam Malkin, scurrying out from 
behind the clothes rack hold-
ing a tape measure and a wand. ÒA
nd I donÕt want wands drawn in 
my shop either!Ó she added hastily,
 for a glance toward the door

 ,,8" had shown her Harry an
d Ron both standing
 there with their 
wands out and pointing at Malf
oy. Hermione, who was standing 
slightly behind them, whispered, 
ÒNo, donÕt, honestly, itÕs not 
worth it. . . .Ó ÒYeah, like youÕd dare do magic 
out of school,Ó sneered Malfoy. 
ÒWho blacked your eye, Granger? 
I want to send them flowers.Ó 
ÒThatÕs quite enough!Ó said Ma
dam Malkin sharply, looking 
over her shoulder for suppo
rt. ÒMadam Ñ please ÑÓ 
Narcissa Malfoy strolled out 
from behind the clothes rack. 
ÒPut those away,Ó she said cold
ly to Harry and Ron. ÒIf you at-
tack my son again, I shall ensure th
at it is the last thing you ever 
do.Ó ÒReally?Ó said Harry, ta
king a step forward and gazing into the 
smoothly arrogant face that, for all 
its pallor, still resembled her sis-
terÕs. He was as tall as she was no
w. ÒGoing to get a few Death Eater 
pals to do us in, are you?Ó 
Madam Malkin squealed and 
clutched at her heart. 
ÒReally, you shouldnÕt accuse Ñ dangerous thing to say Ñ 
wands away, please!Ó 
But Harry did not lower his wa
nd. Narcissa Malfoy smiled 
unpleasantly. ÒI see that being DumbledoreÕs 
favorite has given you a false 
sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore wonÕt always be 
there to protect you.Ó 
Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. ÒWow . . . look 
at that . . . heÕs not 
here now! So why not 
have a go? They might 
be able to find you a double cell 
in Azkaban with your loser of a 
husband!Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*+"
 ,,9" Malfoy made an angry movement
 toward Harry, but stumbled 
over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly. 
ÒDonÕt you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!Ó Malfoy 
snarled. ÒItÕs all right, Draco,Ó said Na
rcissa, restrainin
g him with her 
thin white fingers upon his should
er. ÒI expect Potter will be re-
united with dear Sirius before
 I am reunited 
with Lucius.Ó 
Harry raised his wand higher. 
ÒHarry, no!Ó moaned Hermione, 
grabbing his arm and attempt-
ing to push it down by his side. ÒThin
k. . . . You mustnÕt. . . . YouÕll 
be in such trouble. . . .Ó Madam Malkin dithered for a mom
ent on the spot, then seemed 
to decide to act as though no
thing was happening in the hope 
that it wouldnÕt. She bent toward
 Malfoy, who was still glaring at 
Harry. ÒI think this left sleeve could co
me up a little bit more, dear, let 
me just ÑÓ 
ÒOuch!Ó bellowed Malfoy, slappi
ng her hand away. ÒWatch 
where youÕre putting your pins, woman! Mother Ñ I donÕt think I 
want these anymore ÑÓ 
He pulled the robes over his head
 and threw them onto the floor 
at Madam MalkinÕs feet. 
ÒYouÕre right, Draco,Ó said Na
rcissa, with a contemptuous 
glance at Hermione, Ònow I know
 the kind of sc
um that shops 
here. . . . WeÕll do better at Twilfitt and TattingÕs.Ó 
And with that, the pair of them 
strode out of the shop, Malfoy 
taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out. 
ÒWell, really!Ó said Madam Malkin, snat
ching up the fallen robes  
 /($!01)""/'&02("
 ,,." and moving the tip of 
her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, 
so that it remo
ved all the dust. 
She was distracted all through 
the fitting of RonÕs and HarryÕs 
new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizardÕs dress robes instead of 
witchÕs, and when she finally bowe
d them out of th
e shop it was 
with an air of being glad to see the back of them. 
ÒGot evÕrything?Ó asked Hagrid 
brightly when they reappeared 
at his side. 
ÒJust about,Ó said Harry. ÒDid you see the Malfoys?Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Hagrid, unconcerned. ÒBuÕ they wouldnÕ dare make 
trouble in the middle oÕ Diagon 
Alley, Harry. DonÕ worry abouÕ 
them.Ó Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchan
ged looks, but before they 
could disabuse Hagrid of this 
comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of 
books. 
ÒEveryone all right?Ó said Mrs. We
asley. ÒGot your robes? Right 
then, we can pop in at the Apot
hecary and Eeylops on the way to 
Fred and GeorgeÕs Ñ stic
k close, now. . . .Ó 
Neither Harry nor Ron bought an
y ingredients at the Apothe-
cary, seeing that they were no lo
nger studying Potions, but both 
bought large boxes of owl nuts fo
r Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eey-
lops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mr
s. Weasley checking her watch 
every minute or so, they headed fart
her along the street in search of 
WeasleysÕ Wizard 
Wheezes, the joke shop 
run by Fred and George. 
ÒWe really havenÕt got too long,Ó Mrs. Weasley said. ÒSo weÕll 
just have a quick look around and 
then back to the car. We must be 
close, thatÕs number ninety-t
wo . . . ninety-four . . .Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*+"
 ,,3" ÒWhoa,
Ó said Ron, stopping in his tracks. 
Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts around them, 
Fred and GeorgeÕs windows hit the eye like a firework display. 
Casual passersby were looking back
 over their shoulders at the win-
dows, and a few rather stunned-l
ooking people had actually come 
to a halt, transfixed. The left-han
d window was dazzlingly full of an 
assortment of goods that revolved
, popped, flashed, bounced, and 
shrieked; HarryÕs eyes began to wate
r just looking at it. The right-
hand window was covered with a gi
gantic poster, purple like those 
of the Ministry, but emblazoned 
with flashing yellow letters: 
 !"#$%&'$#()$!(&&#*+,$%-().$

."%.82$,&*55*+,$."'$+%.*(+9$
 Harry started to laugh. He heard a 
weak sort of moan beside him 
and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the 
poster. Her lips moved silently, 
mouthing the na
me ÒU-No-Poo.Ó 
ÒTheyÕll be murdered in th
eir beds!Ó she whispered. 
ÒNo they wonÕt!Ó said Ron, who,
 like Harry, was laughing. ÒThis 
is brilliant!Ó 
And he and Harry led the way into
 the shop. It was packed with 
customers; Harry could not get near 
the shelves. He stared around, 
looking up at the boxes piled to th
e ceiling: Here were the Skiving 
Snackboxes that the twins had per
fected during their last, unfin- 
 /($!01)""/'&02("
 ,,4" ished year at Hogwarts; Harry noti
ced that the Nosebleed Nougat 
was most popular, with only one 
battered box left on the shelf. 
There were bins full of trick wa
nds, the cheapest merely turning 
into rubber chickens or pairs of
 briefs when waved, the most ex-
pensive beating the unwary user 
around the head and neck, and 
boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and 
Smart-Answer varieties. A space 
cleared in the crowd, and Harry 
pushed his way toward the counte
r, where a gaggle of delighted 
ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly as-
cending the steps to a real set of
 gallows, both perched on a box 
that read: 
reusable hangman Ñ spell it or heÕll swing
! ÒÔPatented Daydream Charms . . .ÕÓ 
Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display 
near the counter and was reading th
e information on the back of a 
box bearing a highly colored pict
ure of a handsome youth and a 
swooning girl who were 
standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 
ÒÔOne simple incantation and yo

 at Harry, Òtha
t really is ex-
traordinary magic!Ó 
ÒFor that, Hermione,Ó said a vo
ice behind them, Òyou can have 
one for free.Ó 
A beaming Fred stood before th
em, wearing a set of magenta 
robes that clashed magnificen
tly with his flaming hair. 
ÒHow are you, Harry?Ó They shook hands. ÒAnd whatÕs hap-
pened to your eye, Hermione?Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*+"
 ,,5" ÒYour punching telescope,Ó she said ruefully. 
ÒOh blimey, I forgot about those,Ó said Fred. ÒHere 
ÑÓ He pulled a tub out of his pocket
 and handed it to her; she un-
screwed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste. 
ÒJust dab it on, that bruiseÕll be 
gone within the hour,Ó said Fred. 
ÒWe had to find a decent bruise re
mover. ÒWeÕre test
ing most of our 
products on ourselves.Ó 
Hermione looked 
nervous. ÒIt is 
safe,
 isnÕt it?Ó she asked. 
ÒÕCourse it is,Ó said Fred brac
ingly. ÒCome on, Harry, IÕll give 
you a tour.Ó 
Harry left Hermione dabbing her 
black eye with paste and fol-
lowed Fred toward the back of th
e shop, where he saw a stand of 
card and rope tricks. 
ÒMuggle magic tricks!Ó said Fred
 happily, pointing them out. 
ÒFor freaks like Dad, you know, wh
o love Muggle stuff. ItÕs not a 
big earner, but we do fairly steady 
business, theyÕre great novelties. 
. . . Oh, hereÕs 
George. . . .Ó 
FredÕs twin shook HarryÕs hand energetically. 
ÒGiving him the tour? 
Come through the ba
ck, Harry, thatÕs 
where weÕre making the real money Ñ 
pocket anything, you, and 
youÕll pay in more than Galleons
!Ó he added warningly to a small boy 
who hastily whipped his hand
 out of the tub labeled 
edible dark 
marks Ñ theyÕll make anyone sick
! George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and 
Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the 
products lining these shelves was more subdued. 
ÒWeÕve just developed this more 
serious line,Ó said Fred. ÒFunny 
how it happened . . .Ó 
 /($!01)""/'&02("
 ,,6" ÒYou wouldnÕt believe how many 
people, even people who work 
at the Ministry, canÕt do a decent Shield Charm,Ó said George. 
ÒÕCourse, they didnÕt have 
you teaching them, Harry.Ó 
ÒThatÕs right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a 
laugh, you know, challenge your ma
te to jinx you while wearing it 
and watch his face when the jinx ju
st bounces off. But the Ministry 
bought five hundred for all its supp
ort staff! And weÕre still getting 
massive orders!Ó 
ÒSo weÕve expanded into a rang
e of Shield Cloaks, Shield 
Gloves . . .Ó 
Ò. . . I mean, they wouldnÕt help
 much against the Unforgivable 
Curses, but for minor to modera
te hexes or jinxes . . .Ó 
ÒAnd then we thought weÕd get 
into the whole area of Defense 
Against the Dark Arts, because itÕs such a money spinner,Ó contin-
ued George enthusiastically. ÒThis
 is cool. Look, Instant Darkness 
Powder, weÕre importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make 
a quick escape.Ó 
ÒAnd our Decoy Detonators are 
just walking off the shelves, 
look,Ó said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black 
horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of 
sight. ÒYou just drop 
one surreptitiously and 
itÕll run off and make 
a nice loud noise out of sight, 
giving you a dive
rsion if you need 
one. ÒHandy,Ó said Harry, impressed. 
ÒHere,Ó said George, catching a 
couple and throwing them to 
Harry. A young witch with short blonde 
hair poked her head around the 
curtain; Harry saw that she too wa
s wearing magenta staff robes.

 ,7-" ÒThereÕs a customer out here l
ooking for a joke cauldron, Mr. 
Weasley and Mr. Weasley,Ó she said. 
Harry found it very odd to hear Fr
ed and George called ÒMr. 
Weasley,Ó but they took it in their stride. 
ÒRight you are, Verity, IÕm coming,Ó said George promptly. 
ÒHarry, you help yourself to an
ything you want, all right? No 
charge.Ó 
ÒI canÕt do that!Ó said Harry, who had already pulled out his 
money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. 
ÒYou donÕt pay here,Ó said Fr
ed firmly, waving away HarryÕs 
gold. 
ÒBut ÑÓ 
ÒYou gave us our start-up loan, we havenÕt forgotten,Ó said 
George sternly. ÒTake whatever you 
like, and just remember to tell 
people where you got it, if they ask.Ó 
George swept off through the curtain to help with the cus-
tomers, and Fred led Harry back into
 the main part 
of the shop to 
find Hermione and Ginny still pori
ng over the Patented Daydream 
Charms. ÒHavenÕt you girls found our special WonderWitch products 
yet?Ó asked Fred. ÒFollo
w me, ladies. . . .Ó 
Near the window was an array of
 violently pink products around 
which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermi-
one and Ginny both hung
 back, looking wary. 
ÒThere you go,Ó said Fred proudly. ÒBest range of love potions 
youÕll find anywhere.Ó 
Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. ÒDo they work?Ó she asked. 
ÒCertainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time de-
pending on the weight of 
the boy in question ÑÓ 
/($!01)""/'&02("
 ,7," ÒÑ and the attractiveness of the 
girl,Ó said George, reappearing 
suddenly at their side. ÒBut weÕre no
t selling them to our sister,Ó he 
added, becoming suddenly stern, Ònot when sheÕs already got about 
five boys on the go 
from what weÕve ÑÓ 
ÒWhatever youÕve heard from Ron 
is a big fat lie,Ó said Ginny 
calmly, leaning forward to take 
a small pink pot off the shelf. 
ÒWhatÕs this?Ó 
ÒGuaranteed ten-second pimple va
nisher,Ó said Fred. ÒExcellent 
on everything from boils to blac
kheads, but donÕt change the sub-
ject. Are you or are you not curre
ntly going out with a boy called 
Dean Thomas?Ó 
ÒYes, I am,Ó said Ginny. ÒAnd la
st time I looked, he was defi-
nitely one boy, not five. What are those?Ó 
She was pointing at a number of ro
und balls of fluff in shades of 
pink and purple, all rolling around
 the bottom of a cage and emit-
ting high-pitched squeaks. 
ÒPygmy Puffs,Ó said George. ÒM
iniature puffskeins, we canÕt 
breed them fast enough. So 
what about Michael Corner?Ó 
ÒI dumped him, he was a bad loser,Ó said Ginny, putting a finger 
through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd 
around it. ÒTheyÕre really cute!Ó 
ÒTheyÕre fairly cuddly, yes,Ó conc
eded Fred. ÒBut youÕre moving 
through boyfriends a bi
t fast, arenÕt you?Ó 
Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was 
such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on 
her face that Harry was surprised 
Fred didnÕt recoil. 
ÒItÕs none of your business. And IÕll thank 
you,
Ó she added an-
grily to Ron, who had just appeared
 at GeorgeÕs elbow, laden with 
merchandise, Ònot to tell tales about me to these two!Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+"
 ,77" ÒThatÕs three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,Ó said Fred, ex-
amining the many boxes in RonÕs arms. ÒCough up.Ó 
ÒIÕm your brother!Ó 
ÒAnd thatÕs our stuff youÕre ni
cking. Three Galleons, nine Sick-
les. IÕll knock 
off the Knut.Ó 
ÒBut I havenÕt got three 
Galleons, nine Sickles!Ó 
ÒYouÕd better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right 
shelves.Ó 
Ron dropped several boxes, swor
e, and made a rude hand ges-
ture at Fred that was unfortunat
ely spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who 
had chosen that mo
ment to appear. 
ÒIf I see you do that again IÕll jinx your fingers together,Ó she said 
sharply. ÒMum, can I have a Pygmy Pu
ff?Ó said Ginny at once. 
ÒA what?Ó said Mr
s. Weasley warily. 
ÒLook, theyÕre so sweet. . . .Ó 
Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view 
out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. 
As he passed WeasleysÕ Wizard Wh
eezes, he glanced over his shoul-
der. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and 
they lost sight of him. 
ÒWonder where his mummy is?Ó
 said Harry, frowning. 
ÒGiven her the slip by the looks of it,Ó said Ron. 
ÒWhy, though?Ó said Hermione. 
Harry said nothing; he
 was thinking too ha
rd. Narcissa Malfoy 
would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Mal-
foy must have made a real effort to
 free himself from her clutches.  
 /($!01)""/'&02("
 ,78" Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy
, was sure the reason could not 
be innocent. 
He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over 
the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was de
lightedly examining a pack of 
Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping 
customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing 
with his back to them, look
ing up and down the street. 
ÒGet under here, quick,Ó said 
Harry, pulling his Invisibility 
Cloak out of his bag. 
ÒOh Ñ I donÕt know, Harry,Ó said Hermione, looking uncer-
tainly toward Mrs. Weasley. 
ÒCome 
on!Ó said Ron. 
She hesitated for a second longer
, then ducked under the cloak 
with Harry and Ron. Nobody noti
ced them vanish; they were all 
too interested in Fred and George
Õs products. Harry, Ron, and Her-
mione squeezed their way out of th
e door as quickly as they could, 
but by the time they gained the st
reet, Malfoy had disappeared just 
as successfully 
as they had. 
ÒHe was going in that direction,
Ó murmured Harry as quietly as 
possible, so that the humming 
Hagrid would not hear them. 
ÒCÕmon.Ó 
They scurried along, peering le
ft and right, through shop win-
dows and doors, until He
rmione pointed ahead. 
ÒThatÕs him, isnÕt it?Ó she wh
ispered. ÒTurning left?Ó 
ÒBig surprise,Ó whispered Ron. 
For Malfoy had glanced around, 
then slid into Knockturn Alley 
and out of sight. 
ÒQuick, or weÕll lose him,Ó said Harry, speeding up. 
 !#$%&'("")*+"
 ,79" ÒOur feetÕll be seen!Ó said He
rmione anxiously, as the cloak 
flapped a little around their ankles
; it was much more difficult hid-
ing all three of them under the cloak nowadays. 
ÒIt doesnÕt matter,Ó said Har
ry impatiently. ÒJust hurry!Ó 
But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, 
looked completely deserted. They
 peered into windows as they 
passed, but none of the shops seemed
 to have any customers at all. 
Harry supposed it was a bit of a 
giveaway in these dangerous and 
suspicious times to buy Dark artifa
cts Ñ or at least, to be seen buy-
ing them. 
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch. 
ÒOuch!Ó 
ÒShh! Look! HeÕs in there!Ó she breathed in HarryÕs ear. 
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley 
that Harry had ever visited, Borgin
 and Burkes, which sold a wide 
variety of sinister objects. There 
in the midst of the cases full of 
skulls and old bottles stood Draco 
Malfoy with his back to them, 
just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which 
Harry had once hidden to avoid Malf
oy and his father. Judging by 
the movements of MalfoyÕs hands,
 he was talking animatedly. The 
proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin
, an oily-haired, stooping man, 
stood facing Malfoy. He was wearin
g a curious expression of min-
gled resentment and fear. 
ÒIf only we could hear what th
eyÕre saying!Ó said Hermione. 
ÒWe can!Ó said Ron excitedl
y. ÒHang on Ñ damn ÑÓ He dropped a couple more of the 
boxes he was still clutching as 
he fumbled with the largest. 
ÒExtendable Ears, look!Ó 
ÒFantastic!Ó said Hermione, as
 Ron unraveled the long, flesh-
/($!01)""/'&02("
 ,7." colored strings and began to feed 
them toward the bottom of the 
door. ÒOh, I hope the door 
isnÕt Imperturbable ÑÓ 
ÒNo!Ó said Ron gleefully. ÒListen!Ó 
They put their heads together and 
listened intently to the ends 
of the strings, through which Malf
oyÕs voice could be heard loud 
and clear, as though a radio had been turned on. 
Ò. . . you know how to fix it?Ó 
ÒPossibly,Ó said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwill-
ing to commit himself. ÒIÕll need 
to see it, though. Why donÕt you 
bring it into the shop?Ó 
ÒI canÕt,Ó said Malfoy. ÒItÕs got to
 stay put. I just need you to tell 
me how to do it.Ó 
Harry saw Borgin lick 
his lips nervously. 
ÒWell, without seeing it, I must sa
y it will be a very difficult job, 
perhaps impossible. I couldnÕt guarantee anything.Ó 
ÒNo?Ó said Malfoy, and Harry knew
, just by his tone, that Mal-
foy was sneering. ÒPerhaps this will make you more confident.Ó 
He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the 
cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and 
keep him in sight, but all they 
could see was Borgin, looking very 
frightened. 
ÒTell anyone,Ó said Malfoy, Òand 
there will be retribution. You 
know Fenrir Greyback? HeÕs a family friend. HeÕll be dropping in 
from time to time to make sure yo
uÕre giving the problem your full 
attention.Ó 
ÒThere will be no need for ÑÓ 
ÒIÕll decide that,Ó said Malfoy. ÒW
ell, IÕd better be off. And donÕt 
forget to keep 
that
 one safe, IÕll need it.Ó 
ÒPerhaps youÕd like 
to take it now?Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+"
 ,73" ÒNo, of course I wouldnÕt, you 
stupid little man, how would I 
look carrying that down the street? Just donÕt sell it.Ó 
ÒOf course not . . . sir.Ó 
Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him 
give Lucius Malfoy. 
ÒNot a word to anyone, Borgin, 
and that includes my mother, 
understand?Ó 
ÒNaturally, naturall
y,Ó murmured Borgin
, bowing again. 
Next moment, the bell over the 
door tinkled loudly as Malfoy 
stalked out of the shop looking 
very pleased with himself. He 
passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the 
cloak flutter around their knees 
again. Inside the shop, Borgin 
remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked 
worried. 
ÒWhat was that about?Ó whispere
d Ron, reeling in the Extend-
able Ears. 
ÒDunno,Ó said Harry, thinking
 hard. ÒHe wants something 
mended . . . and he wants to reserv
e something in there. . . . Could 
you see what he pointed at 
when he said 
Ôthat oneÕ?Ó 
ÒNo, he was behind that cabinet ÑÓ 
ÒYou two stay here,Ó
 whispered Hermione. 
ÒWhat are you Ñ ?Ó 
But Hermione had already ducked
 out from under the cloak. 
She checked her hair in the reflec
tion in the glass, then marched 
into the shop, setting the bell ti
nkling again. Ron hastily fed the 
Extendable Ears back under the door
 and passed one of the strings 
to Harry. 
ÒHello, horrible morning, isnÕt it
?Ó Hermione said brightly to 
Borgin, who did not answer, but ca
st her a suspicious look. Hum-
/($!01)""/'&02("
 ,74" ming cheerily, Hermione strolled th
rough the jumble of objects on 
display. ÒIs this necklace for sale?Ó sh
e asked, pausing beside a glass-
fronted case. 
ÒIf youÕve got one and a half 
thousand Galleons,Ó said Mr. 
Borgin coldly. 
ÒOh Ñ er Ñ no, I havenÕt got qu
ite that much,Ó said Hermi-
one, walking on. ÒAnd 
. . . what about this 
lovely Ñ um Ñ skull?Ó 
ÒSixteen Galleons.Ó 
ÒSo itÕs for sale, then? It isnÕ
t being . . . kept
 for anyone?Ó 
Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Ha
rry had the nasty fee
ling he knew 
exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she 
had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the 
winds. ÒThe thing is, that Ñ er Ñ boy who was in here just now, 
Draco Malfoy, well, heÕs a friend of mine, and I want to get him a 
birthday present, but if heÕs already reserved anything, I obviously 
donÕt want to get him the same
 thing, so . 
. . um . . .Ó It was a pretty lame story in HarryÕs opinion, and apparently 
Borgin thought so too. 
ÒOut,Ó he said sharply. ÒGet out!Ó 
Hermione did not 
wait to be asked twic
e, but hurried to the 
door with Borgin at her heels. As
 the bell tinkled again, Borgin 
slammed the door behind
 her and put up the 
closed
 sign. 
ÒAh well,Ó said Ron, throwing 
the cloak back over Hermione. 
ÒWorth a try, but you were a bit obvious ÑÓ 
ÒWell, next time you can show 
me how itÕs done, Master of 
Mystery!Ó she snapped. 
Ron and Hermione bickered al
l the way back to WeasleysÕ 
!#$%&'("")*+"
 ,75" Wizard Wheezes, where they were forc
ed to stop so that they could 
dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and 
Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, 
Harry whipped off the Invisibility 
Cloak, hid it in his bag, and 
joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. 
WeasleyÕs accusations, that they
 had been in the back room all 
along, and that she could 
not have looked properly.

   arry spent a lot of the last we
ek of the holidays ponder-
ing the meaning of MalfoyÕs behavior in Knockturn 
Alley. What disturbed him most wa
s the satisfied look on MalfoyÕs 
face as he had left the shop. Not
hing that made Malfoy look that 
happy could be good news. To his 
slight annoyance, however, nei-
ther Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about MalfoyÕs 
activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of dis-
cussing it after a few days. 
ÒYes, IÕve already agreed it was 
fishy, Harry,Ó said Hermione a lit-
tle impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and 
GeorgeÕs room with he
r feet up on one of th
e cardboard boxes and 
had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of 
Advanced 
Rune Translation.
 ÒBut havenÕt we agreed there could be a lot of 
explanations?Ó ÒMaybe heÕs broken his 
Hand of Glory,Ó said Ron vaguely, as he  
 #"!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,34" attempted to straighten
 his broomstickÕs bent
 tail twigs. ÒRemem-
ber that shriveled-up
 arm Malfoy had?Ó 
ÒBut what about when he said, ÔDonÕt forget to keep 
that one 
safeÕ?Ó asked Harry for the umpte
enth time. ÒThat sounded to me 
like BorginÕs got another one of
 the broken objects, and Malfoy 
wants both.Ó 
ÒYou reckon?Ó said Ron, now tryi
ng to scrape some dirt off his 
broom handle. 
ÒYeah, I do,Ó said Harry. Wh
en neither Ron no
r Hermione an-
swered, he said, ÒMalfoyÕs fatherÕs in Azkaban. DonÕt you think 
MalfoyÕd like revenge?Ó 
Ron looked up, blinking. 
ÒMalfoy, revenge? What
 can he do about it?Ó 
ÒThatÕs my point, I donÕt know!Ó sa
id Harry, frustrated. ÒBut heÕs 
up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His fatherÕs 
a Death Eater and ÑÓ 
Harry broke off, his eyes fixe
d on the window
 behind Hermi-
one, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him. 
ÒHarry?Ó said Hermio
ne in an anxious vo
ice. ÒWhatÕs wrong?Ó 
ÒYour scarÕs not hurting again, 
is it?Ó asked Ron nervously. 
ÒHeÕs a Death Eater,Ó said Harry sl
owly. ÒHeÕs replaced his father 
as a Death Eater!Ó 
There was a silence; then 
Ron erupted in laughter. Ò
Malfoy? HeÕs 
sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let 
Malfoy
 join?Ó 
ÒIt seems very unlikely, Harry,Ó sa
id Hermione in a repressive 
sort of voice. ÒWhat 
makes you think Ñ ?Ó 
ÒIn Madam MalkinÕs. She didnÕt 
touch him, but he yelled and 
jerked his arm away from her when 
she went to roll up his sleeve. 
It was his left arm. HeÕs been branded with the Dark Mark.Ó 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,3," Ron and Hermione look
ed at each other. 
ÒWell . . .Ó said Ron, soundi
ng thoroughly unconvinced. 
ÒI think he just wanted to get 
out of there, Harry,Ó said Hermi-
one. ÒHe showed Borgin something we couldnÕt see,Ó Harry pressed 
on stubbornly. ÒSomething that seri
ously scared Borgin. It was the 
Mark, I know it Ñ he was showing Borgin who he was dealing 
with, you saw how seriou
sly Borgin took him!Ó 
Ron and Hermione exchanged another look. 
ÒIÕm not sure, Harry. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, I still donÕt reckon Yo
u-Know-Who would let Malfoy 
join. . . .Ó 
Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched 
up a pile of filthy Qu
idditch robes and left 
the room; Mrs. Weasley 
had been urging them for days not 
to leave their wa
shing and pack-
ing until the last moment. On the 
landing he bumped into Ginny, 
who was returning to her room car
rying a pile of freshly laundered 
clothes. ÒI wouldnÕt go in the kitch
en just now,Ó she warned him. 
ÒThereÕs a lot of Phlegm around.Ó 
ÒIÕll be careful not to slip in it.Ó Harry smiled. 
Sure enough, when he entered the 
kitchen it was to find Fleur 
sitting at the kitchen ta
ble, in full flow abou
t plans for her wedding 
to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling 
sprouts, looking bad-tempered. 
Ò. . . Bill and I Õave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, 
Ginny and Gabrielle will
 look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking 
of dressing zem in pale gold Ñ 
pink would of course be Õorrible 
with GinnyÕs Õair ÑÓ 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,3-" ÒAh, Harry!Ó said Mrs. Weasle
y loudly, cutting across FleurÕs 
monologue. ÒGood, I wanted to ex
plain about the security arrange-
ments for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. WeÕve got Ministry 
cars again, and there will be Au
rors waiting at 
the station ÑÓ 
ÒIs Tonks going to be there?Ó asked Harry, handing over his 
Quidditch things. 
ÒNo, I donÕt think so, sheÕs been stationed somewhere else from 
what Arthur said.Ó 
ÒShe has let Õerself go, zat Tonk
s,Ó Fleur mused, examining her 
own stunning reflection in the ba
ck of a teaspoon. ÒA big mistake 
if you ask ÑÓ 
ÒYes, 
thank you,Ó said Mrs. Weasley ta
rtly, cutting across Fleur 
again. ÒYouÕd better get on, Harry, 
I want the trunks ready tonight, 
if possible, so we donÕt have 
the usual last-minute scramble.Ó 
And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother 
than usual. The Ministry cars glid
ed up to the front of the Burrow 
to find them waiting, trunks pa
cked; HermioneÕs cat, Crookshanks, 
safely enclosed in his traveling ba
sket; and Hedwig; RonÕs owl, Pig-
widgeon; and GinnyÕs new purple 
Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. 
ÒAu revoir, ÕArry,Ó said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. 
Ron hurried forward, looking ho
peful, but Ginny stuck out her 
foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the 
dust at FleurÕs feet. Furious, red-
faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurri
ed into the car without saying 
good-bye. There was no cheerful Hagrid wait
ing for them at KingÕs Cross 
Station. Instead, two grim-faced, 
bearded Aurors in dark Muggle 
suits moved forward the moment th
e cars stopped 
and, flanking 
the party, marched them into 
the station without speaking. 
ÒQuick, quick, through the barri
er,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, who 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,33" seemed a little flustere
d by this austere effi
ciency. ÒHarry had bet-
ter go first, with ÑÓ 
She looked inquiringly at one of
 the Aurors, who nodded briefly, 
seized HarryÕs upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the 
barrier between platfo
rms nine and ten. 
ÒI can walk, thanks,Ó said Harry 
irritably, jerking his arm out of 
the AurorÕs grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, 
ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, 
standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet 
Hogwarts Express stood belchi
ng steam over the crowd. 
Hermione and the Weasleys join
ed him within seconds. With-
out waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to 
Ron and Hermione to follow him up
 the platform, looking for an 
empty compartment. 
ÒWe canÕt, Harry,Ó said Hermione
, looking apologetic. ÒRon and 
IÕve got to go to the prefectsÕ carri
age first and then patrol the cor-
ridors for a bit.Ó 
ÒOh yeah, I forgot,Ó said Harry. 
ÒYouÕd better get straight on the tr
ain, all of you, youÕve only got 
a few minutes to go,Ó said Mrs. 
Weasley, consulting her watch. 
ÒWell, have a lovely
 term, Ron. . . .Ó 
ÒMr. Weasley, can I have a quic
k word?Ó said Harry, making up 
his mind on the spur of the moment. 
ÒOf course,Ó said Mr. Weasley, 
who looked slightly surprised, 
but followed Harry out of earsho
t of the others nevertheless. 
Harry had thought it 
through carefully and come to the conclu-
sion that, if he was to tell an
yone, Mr. Weasley was the right per-
son; firstly, because he worked at 
the Ministry and was therefore in 
the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,35" because he thought that there 
was not too much risk of Mr. 
Weasley exploding with anger. 
He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the 
pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away. 
ÒWhen we were in Diagon Alle
y,Ó Harry began, but Mr. Weasley 
forestalled him with a grimace. 
ÒAm I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disap-
peared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred 
and GeorgeÕs shop?Ó 
ÒHow did you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒHarry, please. YouÕre talking to
 the man who raised Fred and 
George.Ó 
ÒEr . . . yeah, all right, we 
werenÕt in the back room.Ó 
ÒVery well, then, letÕs hear the worst.Ó 
ÒWell, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility 
Cloak.Ó 
ÒDid you have any particular re
ason for doing so, or was it a 
mere whim?Ó 
ÒBecause I thought Malfoy was up to something,Ó said Harry, dis-
regarding Mr. WeasleyÕs look of 
mingled exasperation and amuse-
ment. ÒHeÕd given his mother the sl
ip and I wanted to know why.Ó 
ÒOf course you did,Ó said Mr. 
Weasley, sounding resigned. 
ÒWell? Did you 
find out why?Ó 
ÒHe went into Borgin and Burkes,Ó said Harry, Òand started bul-
lying the bloke in there, Borgin, to
 help him fix something. And he 
said he wanted Borgin to keep so
mething else for him. He made it 
sound like it was the same kind 
of thing that needed fixing. Like 
they were a pa
ir. And . . .Ó 
Harry took a deep breath. 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,36" ÒThereÕs something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile 
when Madam Malkin tried to touch his
 left arm. I think heÕs been 
branded with the Dark Mark. I think heÕs replaced his father as a 
Death Eater.Ó 
Mr. Weasley looked taken abac
k. After a moment he said, 
ÒHarry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-
year-old ÑÓ 
ÒDoes anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or 
wouldnÕt do?Ó asked Harry angrily. ÒMr. Weasley, IÕm sorry, but 
isnÕt it worth investigating? If 
Malfoy wants something fixing, and 
he needs to threaten Borgin to get 
it done, itÕs probably something 
Dark or dangerous, isnÕt it?Ó 
ÒI doubt it, to be honest, Harry,
Ó said Mr. Weasley slowly. ÒYou 
see, when Lucius Malfoy was arre
sted, we raided his house. We 
took away everything that 
might have been dangerous.Ó 
ÒI think you missed
 something,Ó said Harry stubbornly. 
ÒWell, maybe,Ó said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. 
Weasley was humoring him. 
There was a whistle behind them
; nearly everyone had boarded 
the train and the doors were closing. 
ÒYouÕd better hurry,Ó said Mr. We
asley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, 
ÒHarry, quickly!Ó 
He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load 
his trunk onto the train. 
ÒNow, dear, youÕre coming to us fo
r Christmas, itÕs all fixed with 
Dumbledore, so weÕll see you qu
ite soon,Ó said Mrs. Weasley 
through the window, as Harry sl
ammed the door shut behind him 
and the train began to 
move. ÒYou make sure you look after your-
self and ÑÓ 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,37" The train was gathering speed. 
ÒÑ be good and ÑÓ 
She was jogging to keep up now. 
ÒÑ stay safe!Ó 
Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and 
Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, th
en turned to see where the others 
had got to. He supposed Ron and He
rmione were cloistered in the 
prefectsÕ carriage, but Ginny was 
a little way along the corridor, 
chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his 
trunk. 
People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed 
their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look 
at him. He had expected an upswin
g in the amount of gaping and 
gawping he would have to endure this term after all the ÒChosen 
OneÓ rumors in the 
Daily Prophet,
 but he did not enjoy the sensa-
tion of standing in a very bright 
spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the 
shoulder. 
ÒFancy trying to fi
nd a compartment?Ó 
ÒI canÕt, Harry, I said IÕd meet 
Dean,Ó said Ginny brightly. ÒSee 
you later.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry. He felt a stra
nge twinge of annoyance as she 
walked away, her long red hair da
ncing behind her; he had become 
so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost 
forgotten that Ginny did not hang
 around with him, Ron, and 
Hermione while at school. Then 
he blinked and looked around: 
He was surrounded by mesmerized girls. 
ÒHi, Harry!Ó said a familiar voice from behind him. 
ÒNeville!Ó said Harry in relief, 
turning to see a round-faced boy 
struggling toward him. 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,38" ÒHello, Harry,Ó said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, 
who was just be
hind Neville. 
ÒLuna, hi, how are you?Ó 
ÒVery well, thank you,Ó said Lu
na. She was clutching a magazine 
to her chest; large letters on th
e front announced 
that there was a 
pair of free Spectrespecs inside. 
ÒQuibbler still going strong, then?Ó 
asked Harry, who felt a cer-
tain fondness for the magazine, havi
ng given it an exclusive inter-
view the previous year. 
ÒOh yes, circulationÕs well up,Ó said Luna happily. 
ÒLetÕs find seats,Ó said Harry, an
d the three of them set off along 
the train through hordes of silently
 staring students. At last they 
found an empty compartment, and 
Harry hurried inside gratefully. 
ÒTheyÕre even staring at 
us!Ó said Neville, indicating himself and 
Luna. ÒBecause weÕre with you!Ó 
ÒTheyÕre staring at you because 
you were at the Ministry too,Ó 
said Harry, as he hoisted his tr
unk into the luggage rack. ÒOur 
little adventure there was all over the 
Daily Prophet,
 you mustÕve 
seen it.Ó 
ÒYes, I thought Gran would be 
angry about all the publicity,Ó 
said Neville, Òbut she was really pleased. Says IÕm starting to live up 
to my dad at long last. She 
bought me a new wand, look!Ó 
He pulled it out and 
showed it to Harry. 
ÒCherry and unicorn hair,Ó he said proudly. ÒWe think it was 
one of the last Ollivander ever 
sold, he vanished next day Ñ oi, 
come back here, Trevor!Ó 
And he dived under the seat to retr
ieve his toad as it made one of 
its frequent bids for freedom. 
ÒAre we still doing D.A. meetin
gs this year, Ha
rry?Ó asked Luna, 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,39" who was detaching a pair of psyche
delic spectacles from the middle 
of The Quibbler.
 ÒNo point now weÕve got rid of Um
bridge, is there?Ó said Harry, 
sitting down. Neville bumped his 
head against the seat as he 
emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed. 
ÒI liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!Ó 
ÒI enjoyed the meetings too,Ó sa
id Luna serenely. ÒIt was like 
having friends.Ó 
This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and 
which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrass-
ment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance 
outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was 
whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass. 
ÒYou ask him!Ó 
ÒNo, you!Ó 
ÒIÕll do it!Ó 
And one of them, a bold-looking 
girl with large dark eyes, a 
prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the 
door. ÒHi, Harry, IÕm Romilda, Romild
a Vane,Ó she said loudly and 
confidently. ÒWhy donÕt you join
 us in our compartment? You 
donÕt have to sit with 
them,Ó she added in a stage whisper, indicat-
ing NevilleÕs bottom, which was st
icking out from under the seat 
again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now 
wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a de-
mented, multicolored owl. 
ÒTheyÕre friends of mine
,Ó said Harry coldly. 
ÒOh,Ó said the girl, looking 
very surprised. ÒOh. Okay.Ó 
And she withdrew, sliding th
e door closed behind her. 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,3." ÒPeople expect you to have cooler friends than us,Ó said Luna, 
once again displaying her knac
k for embarrassing honesty. 
ÒYou are cool,Ó said Harry shortl
y. ÒNone of them was at the 
Ministry. They didnÕt
 fight with me.Ó 
ÒThatÕs a very nice thing to say,
Ó beamed Luna. Then she pushed 
her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read 
The Quibbler.
 ÒWe didnÕt face 
him,
 though,Ó said Neville, emerging from un-
der the seat with fluff and dust 
in his hair and a resigned-looking 
Trevor in his hand. ÒYou did. You 
should hear my gran talk about 
you. Ô
That Harry PotterÕs got more b
ackbone than the whole Ministry 
of Magic put together
!Õ SheÕd give anything to have you as a grand-
son. . . .Ó 
Harry laughed uncomfortably an
d changed the subject to 
O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades 
and wondered aloud whether he wo
uld be allowed to take a Trans-
figuration N.E.W.T. with only an ÒAcceptable,Ó Harry watched him 
without really listening. 
NevilleÕs childhood had been blig
hted by Voldemort just as 
much as HarryÕs had, but Neville 
had no idea how close he had 
come to having HarryÕs destiny. 
The prophecy could have referred 
to either of them, yet, for his 
own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort 
had chosen to believe that
 Harry was the one meant. 
Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it
 would be Neville sitting op-
posite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of 
the prophecy. . . . Or would it? Wo
uld NevilleÕs mother have died 
to save him, as Lily had died fo
r Harry? Surely she would. . . . But 
what if she had been unable to 
stand between her son and Volde-
mort? Would there then have been no ÒChosen OneÓ at all? An 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,54" empty seat where Neville now sa
t and a scarless Harry who would 
have been kissed good-bye by
 his own mother
, not RonÕs? 
ÒYou all right, Harry? You 
look funny,Ó said Neville. 
Harry started. ÒSorry Ñ I ÑÓ 
ÒWrackspurt got you?Ó asked Luna sympathetically, peering at 
Harry through her enormo
us colored spectacles. 
ÒI Ñ what?Ó 
ÒA Wrackspurt . . . TheyÕre invisi
ble. They float in through your 
ears and make your brain go fuzzy,Ó she said. ÒI thought I felt one 
zooming around in here.Ó 
She flapped her hands at thin ai
r, as though beating off large 
invisible moths. Harry 
and Neville caught each otherÕs eyes and 
hastily began to talk of Quidditch. 
The weather beyond th
e train windows was as
 patchy as it had 
been all summer; they passed throug
h stretches of the chilling mist, 
then out into weak, clear sunlight. 
It was during one of the clear 
spells, when the sun was visible al
most directly overhead, that Ron 
and Hermione entered th
e compartment at last. 
ÒWish the lunch trolley would hurry up, IÕm starving,Ó said Ron 
longingly, slumping into the se
at beside Harry 
and rubbing his 
stomach. ÒHi, Neville.
 Hi, Luna. Guess what?Ó
 he added, turning 
to Harry. ÒMalfoyÕs not doing prefec
t duty. HeÕs just sitting in his 
compartment with the other Sl
ytherins, we saw him when we 
passed.Ó 
Harry sat up straight, interested. It
 was not like Malfoy to pass 
up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had 
happily abused all 
the previous year. 
ÒWhat did he do when he saw you?Ó 
ÒThe usual,Ó said Ron indifferentl
y, demonstrating a rude hand 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,5," gesture. ÒNot like him, though, is it? Well Ñ 
that isÓ Ñ he did the 
hand gesture again Ñ Òbut why is
nÕt he out there bullying first 
years? ÒDunno,Ó said Harry, but his mind
 was racing. DidnÕt this look 
as though Malfoy had more impo
rtant things on his mind than 
bullying younger students? 
ÒMaybe he preferred the Inquisit
orial Squad,Ó said Hermione. 
ÒMaybe being a prefect seem
s a bit tame 
after that.Ó 
ÒI donÕt think so,Ó said Harry. ÒI think heÕs ÑÓ 
But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment 
door slid open again and a breathle
ss third-year girl
 stepped inside. 
ÒIÕm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry 
P-Potter,Ó she faltered, as her eyes met HarryÕs and she turned scar-
let. She was holding out two scroll
s of parchment ti
ed with violet 
ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville
 took the scroll addressed to 
each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment. 
ÒWhat is it?Ó Ron demanded
, as Harry unrolled his. 
ÒAn invitation,Ó said Harry. 
 Harry, I would be delighted if you wo
uld join me for a bite of 
lunch in compartment C.
 Sincerely,
 !"#$%&&#"'()'*)'+)',-./0#"1'
ÒWhoÕs Professor Slughorn?Ó aske
d Neville, look
ing perplexedly 
at his own invitation. 
ÒNew teacher,Ó said Harry. ÒWell,
 I suppose weÕll have to go, 
wonÕt we?Ó 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,5-" ÒBut what does he want me fo
r?Ó asked Neville nervously, as 
though he was expecting detention. 
ÒNo idea,Ó said Harry, which was 
not entirely true, though he 
had no proof yet that his hunch 
was correct. ÒListen,Ó he added, 
seized by a sudden br
ain wave, ÒletÕs go under the Invisibility 
Cloak, then we might get a good l
ook at Malfoy on the way, see 
what heÕs up to.Ó 
This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were 
packed with people on
 the lookout for the lunch trolley, were im-
possible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it re-
gretfully back in his bag, reflecting
 that it would have been nice to 
wear it just to avoid all the starin
g, which seemed to have increased 
in intensity even since he had la
st walked down the train. Every 
now and then, students would hurt
le out of their compartments 
to get a better look at him. Th
e exception was Cho Chang, who 
darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As 
Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conver-
sation with her friend Marietta, 
who was wearing a 
very thick layer 
of makeup that did not entirely 
obscure the odd formation of pim-
ples still etched across her face. Sm
irking slightly, Harry pushed on. 
When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that 
they were not SlughornÕs only invitees, although judging by the 
enthusiasm of SlughornÕs welcome, Harry was the most warmly 
anticipated. ÒHarry, mÕboy!Ó said Slughorn, ju
mping up at the sight of him 
so that his great velvet-covered be
lly seemed to fill all the remain-
ing space in the compartment. Hi
s shiny bald head and great sil-
very mustache gleamed as brightly
 in the sunlight as the golden  
 &#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,53" buttons on his waistcoat. ÒGood to see you, good to see you! And 
you must be Mr. Longbottom!Ó 
Neville nodded, looking scared. 
At a gesture from Slughorn, 
they sat down opposite each othe
r in the only two empty seats, 
which were nearest the door. Harry 
glanced around at their fellow 
guests. He recognized a Slytherin 
from their year, a tall black boy 
with high cheekbones and long, slan
ting eyes; there were also two 
seventh-year boys Harry did not kn
ow and, squashed in the corner 
beside Slughorn and looking as th
ough she was not entirely sure 
how she had got there, Ginny. 
ÒNow, do you know everyone?Ó Slughorn asked Harry and 
Neville. ÒBlaise Zabini is in
 your year, of course ÑÓ 
Zabini did not make any sign of 
recognition or greeting, nor did 
Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and 
Slytherin student
s loathed each 
other on principle. 
ÒThis is Cormac McLaggen, perh
aps youÕve come across each 
other Ñ ? No?Ó 
McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired yo
uth, raised a hand, and Harry 
and Neville nodde
d back at him. 
ÒÑ and this is Marcus Belby,
 I donÕt know 
whether Ñ ?Ó 
Belby, who was thin an
d nervous-looking, gave
 a strained smile. 
ÒÑ and 
this
 charming young lady tells me she knows you!Ó 
Slughorn finished. 
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Nevi
lle from behind SlughornÕs 
back. ÒWell now, this is most pleasa
nt,Ó said Slughorn cozily. ÒA 
chance to get to know you all a 
little better. Here, take a napkin. 
IÕve packed my own lunch; the trolle

 ,55" licorice wands, and a poor old manÕ
s digestive system isnÕt quite up 
to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?Ó Belby started and accepted what lo
oked like half 
a cold pheasant. 
ÒI was just telling young Marcus 
here that I had the pleasure of 
teaching his Uncle Damocles,Ó 
Slughorn told Harry and Neville, 
now passing around a basket of rolls. ÒOutstanding wizard, out-
standing, and his Order of Merlin 
most well-deserved. Do you see 
much of your uncle, Marcus?Ó 
Unfortunately, Belby had just ta
ken a large mouthful of pheas-
ant; in his haste to answer Slugho
rn he swallowed too fast, turned 
purple, and began to choke. 
ÒAnapneo,Ó said Slughorn calmly, poin
ting his wand at Belby, 
whose airway seemed to clear at once. 
ÒNot . . . not much of him, no,Ó 
gasped Belby, his eyes streaming. 
ÒWell, of course, I daresay heÕs
 busy,Ó said Slughorn, looking 
questioningly at Belby. ÒI doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion 
without considerable hard work!Ó 
ÒI suppose . . .Ó said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another 
bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with 
him. ÒEr . . . he and my
 dad donÕt get on very well, you see, so I 
donÕt really know 
much about . . .Ó 
His voice tailed away as Slugho
rn gave him a cold smile and 
turned to McLaggen instead. 
ÒNow, you, Cormac,Ó said Slughorn, ÒI
 happen to know you see 
a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, beca
use he has a rather splendid pic-
ture of the two of you hunting 
nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?Ó ÒOh, yeah, that was fun, that 
was,Ó said McLaggen. ÒWe went 
with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour Ñ this was before he be-
came Minister, obviously ÑÓ 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,56" ÒAh, you know Bertie and Rufu
s too?Ó beamed Slughorn, now 
offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed 
out. ÒNow tell me . . .Ó 
It was as Harry had suspected. 
Everyone here seemed to have 
been invited because they were
 connected to somebody well-
known or influential Ñ everyone
 except Ginny. Zabini, who was 
interrogated after McLaggen, turned
 out to have a famously beau-
tiful witch for a mother (from wh
at Harry could make out, she 
had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteri-
ously and leaving her mo
unds of gold). It wa
s NevilleÕs turn next: 
This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for NevilleÕs parents, 
well-known Aurors, had been tortured
 into insanity by Bellatrix 
Lestrange and a couple of Death 
Eater cronies. At the end of 
NevilleÕs interview, Harry had the 
impression that Slughorn was 
reserving judgment on Neville, yet 
to see whether he had any of his 
parentsÕ flair. 
ÒAnd now,Ó said Slughorn, shifting
 massively in his seat with the 
air of a compere introducing his star act. ÒHarry Potter! 
Where to 
begin? I feel I barely scratched 
the surface when we met over the 
summer!Ó He contemplated Harry 
for a moment as though he was 
a particularly large and succulen
t piece of pheasant, then said, 
ÒÔThe Chosen One,Õ theyÕre calling you now!Ó 
Harry said nothing. Belby, McLagg
en, and Zabini were all star-
ing at him. 
ÒOf course,Ó said Slughorn, watc
hing Harry closely, Òthere have 
been rumors for years. . . . I re
member when Ñ well Ñ after that 
terrible night Ñ Lily Ñ James Ñ an
d you survived Ñ and the 
word was that you must have po
wers beyond the ordinary ÑÓ 
Zabini gave a tiny little coug
h that was clearly supposed to 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,57" indicate amused skepticism. An 
angry voice burst out from behind 
Slughorn. 
ÒYeah, Zabini, because 
youÕre
 so talented . . . 
at posing. . . .Ó 
ÒOh dear!Ó chuckled Slughorn co
mfortably, looking around at 
Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini 
around SlughornÕs great belly. 
ÒYou want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the 
most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as
 I was passing her carriage! I 
wouldnÕt cross her!Ó 
Zabini merely looked contemptuous. 
ÒAnyway,Ó said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. Ò
Such rumors 
this summer. Of course, one doesn
Õt know what to
 believe, the 
Prophet
 has been known to print in
accuracies, make mistakes Ñ 
but there seems little doubt, given 
the number of witnesses, that 
there was 
quite
 a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were 
there in the thic
k of it all!Ó 
Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly 
lying, nodded but still said noth
ing. Slughorn beamed at him. 
ÒSo modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond Ñ 
you were there, then? But the rest of th
e stories Ñ so sensational, of 
course, one doesnÕt know quite what to believe Ñ this fabled 
prophecy, for instance ÑÓ 
ÒWe never heard a prophecy,Ó said Neville, turning geranium 
pink as he said it. 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Ginny staunchly. ÒNeville and I were both 
there too, and all this ÔChos
en OneÕ rubbish is just the 
Prophet
 making things up as usual.Ó 
ÒYou were both there too, were 
you?Ó said Slughorn with great 
interest, looking from Ginny to Nevi
lle, but both of them sat clam-
like before his en
couraging smile. 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,58" ÒYes . . . well . . . it is true that the 
Prophet
 often exaggerates, of 
course. . . .Ó Slughorn said, soun
ding a little disappointed. ÒI re-
member dear Gwenog telling me
 (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of 
course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) ÑÓ 
He meandered off into a long
-winded reminiscence, but Harry 
had the distinct impression that 
Slughorn had not finished with 
him, and that he had not been 
convinced by Neville and Ginny. 
The afternoon wore on with mo
re anecdotes about illustrious 
wizards Slughorn had taught, all 
of whom had been delighted to 
join what he called the ÒSlug 
ClubÓ at Hogwarts. Harry could not 
wait to leave, but couldnÕt see 
how to do so politely. Finally the 
train emerged from yet another lo
ng misty stretch 
into a red sun-
set, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight. 
ÒGood gracious, itÕs getting dark 
already! I didnÕt notice that 
theyÕd lit the lamps! YouÕd better 
go and change into your robes, 
all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book 
on nogtails. Harry, Blaise Ñ any 
time youÕre passing. Same goes 
for you, miss,Ó he twinkled at Gi
nny. ÒWell, off you go, off you 
go!Ó As he pushed past Harry into 
the darkening corridor, Zabini 
shot him a filthy look that Ha
rry returned with
 interest. He, 
Ginny, and Neville followed Za
bini back along the train. 
ÒIÕm glad thatÕs over,Ó muttered Neville. ÒStrange man, isnÕt he?Ó 
ÒYeah, he is a bit,Ó said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. ÒHow come 
you ended up in there, Ginny?Ó 
ÒHe saw me hex Zacharias Smith,Ó said Ginny. ÒYou remember 
that idiot from Hufflepuff who was 
in the D.A.? He kept on and on 
asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he 
annoyed me so much I hexed him Ñ when Slughorn came in I 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,59" thought I was going to get detention, but he just thought it was a 
really good hex and invited 
me to lunch!
 Mad, eh?Ó 
ÒBetter reason for inviting someone than because their motherÕs 
famous,Ó said Harry, scowling at th
e back of ZabiniÕs head, Òor be-
cause their uncle ÑÓ 
But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless 
but potentially wonderful idea. . . 
. In a minuteÕs time, Zabini was 
going to reenter the Slytherin si
xth-year compartment and Malfoy 
would be sitting there, thinking
 himself unheard by anybody ex-
cept fellow Slytherins. . . . If Harry could only enter, unseen, be-
hind him, what might he not see or
 hear? True, there was little of 
the journey left Ñ Hogsmeade Statio
n had to be less than half an 
hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the 
windows Ñ but nobody else seemed prepared to take HarryÕs sus-
picions seriously, so it wa
s down to him to prove them. 
ÒIÕll see you two later,Ó said Harry under his breath, pulling out 
his Invisibility Cloak and 
flinging it over himself. 
ÒBut whatÕre you Ñ ?Ó asked Neville. 
ÒLater!Ó whispered Harry, darting 
after Zabini as quietly as pos-
sible, though the rattling of th
e train made such caution almost 
pointless. The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly every-
one had returned to th
eir carriages to change
 into their school 
robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he 
could get to Zabini without to
uching him, Harry was not quick 
enough to slip into the compar
tment when Zabini opened the 
door. Zabini was already sliding it
 shut when Harry
 hastily stuck 
out his foot to prevent it closing. 
 &#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,5." ÒWhatÕs wrong with this thing?
Ó said Zabini angrily as he 
smashed the sliding door repeatedly into HarryÕs foot. 
Harry seized the door and pushed 
it open, hard; Zabini, still 
clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory 
GoyleÕs lap, and in the ensuing 
ruckus, Harry darted into the com-
partment, leapt onto ZabiniÕs te
mporarily empty seat, and hoisted 
himself up into the luggage rack. 
It was fortunate that Goyle and 
Zabini were snarling at each othe
r, drawing all eyes onto them, for 
Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the 
cloak had flapped around them; 
indeed, for one 
horrible moment 
he thought he saw MalfoyÕs eyes follow his trainer as it whipped up-
ward out of sight. But then Goyl
e slammed the door shut and flung 
Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed in
to his own seat looking ruffled, 
Vincent Crabbe returned
 to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay 
back down across two seats with his head in Pansy ParkinsonÕs lap. 
Harry lay curled uncomfortably un
der the cloak to ensure that 
every inch of him remained hidde
n, and watched Pansy stroke the 
sleek blond hair off MalfoyÕs fore
head, smirking as she did so, as 
though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The 
lanterns swinging from the carriage
 ceiling cast a bright light over 
the scene: Harry could read every wo
rd of CrabbeÕs comic directly 
below him. 
ÒSo, Zabini,Ó said Malfoy, 
Òwhat did Slughorn want?Ó 
ÒJust trying to make up to well-connected people,Ó said Zabini, 
who was still glowering at Goyle. 
ÒNot that he managed to find 
many.Ó 
This information did not seem to please Malfoy. 
ÒWho else had he invited?Ó he demanded. 
 !#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,64" ÒMcLaggen from Gryffindor,Ó said Zabini. 
ÒOh yeah, his uncleÕs big in the Ministry,Ó said Malfoy. 
ÒÑ someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw ÑÓ 
ÒNot him, heÕs a prat!Ó said Pansy. 
ÒÑ and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,Ó finished 
Zabini. Malfoy sat up very suddenly, kn
ocking PansyÕs hand aside. 
ÒHe invited 
Longbottom?Ó ÒWell, I assume so, as Longbo
ttom was there,Ó said Zabini 
indifferently. 
ÒWhatÕs Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?Ó 
Zabini shrugged. 
ÒPotter, precious Potter, obvi
ously he wanted a look at Ô
the Cho-
sen One,
ÕÓ sneered Malfoy, Òbut that We
asley girl! WhatÕs so special 
about 
her?Ó ÒA lot of boys like her,Ó said Pa
nsy, watching Malfoy out of the 
corner of her eyes for his reaction. ÒEven you think sheÕs good-
looking, donÕt you, Blaise, and we
 all know how hard you are to 
please!Ó ÒI wouldnÕt touch a filthy littl
e blood traitor like her whatever 
she looked like,Ó said Zabini co
ldly, and Pansy looked pleased. 
Malfoy sank back across her lap 
and allowed her to resume the 
stroking of his hair. 
ÒWell, I pity SlughornÕs taste.
 Maybe heÕs going a bit senile. 
Shame, my father always said he 
was a good wizard 
in his day. My 
father used to be a bit 
of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasnÕt 
heard IÕm on the train, or ÑÓ 
ÒI wouldnÕt bank on an invitati
on,Ó said Zabini. ÒHe asked me 
about NottÕs father when I first 
arrived. They used to be old 
&#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,6," friends, apparently, but when he heard heÕd been caught at the 
Ministry he didnÕt look happy, an
d Nott didnÕt get an invitation, 
did he? I donÕt think 
SlughornÕs interested in Death Eaters.Ó 
Malfoy looked angry, but forc
ed out a singularly humorless 
laugh. ÒWell, who cares what heÕs interested in? What is he, when you 
come down to it? Just some stupid
 teacher.Ó Malfoy yawned osten-
tatiously. ÒI mean, I might not 
even be at Hogwarts next year, 
whatÕs it matter to me if some 
fat old has-been li
kes me or not?Ó 
ÒWhat do you mean, you might not 
be at Hogwarts next year?Ó 
said Pansy indignantly, ceasin
g grooming Malf
oy at once. 
ÒWell, you never know,Ó said Malf
oy with the ghost of a smirk. 
ÒI might have Ñ er Ñ moved on to bigger and better things.Ó 
Crouched in the luggage rack un
der his cloak, HarryÕs heart be-
gan to race. What would Ron 
and Hermione say about this? 
Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at
 Malfoy; apparently they had 
had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. 
Even Zabini had allowed a look of 
curiosity to mar his haughty fea-
tures. Pansy resumed the slow stro
king of MalfoyÕs hair, looking 
dumbfounded. ÒDo you mean Ñ 
Him?Ó Malfoy shrugged. 
ÒMother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I 
donÕt see it as that im
portant these days. I mean
, think about it. . . . 
When the Dark Lord takes over, is
 he going to care how many 
O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s 
anyoneÕs got? Of course he
 isnÕt. . . . 
ItÕll be all 
about the kind of service he receiv
ed, the level of devotion he was 
shown.Ó 
ÒAnd you think 
youÕll
 be able to do something for him?Ó asked 
!#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,6-" Zabini scathingly. ÒSixteen years 
old and not even fully qualified 
yet?Ó ÒIÕve just said, havenÕt 
I? Maybe he doesnÕt care if IÕm qualified. 
Maybe the job he wants me to do isnÕt something that you need to 
be qualified for,Ó sa
id Malfoy quietly. 
Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like 
gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down 
at Malfoy as though she had 
never seen anything 
so awe-inspiring. 
ÒI can see Hogwarts,Ó said Malf
oy, clearly relishing the effect he 
had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. ÒWeÕd bet-
ter get our robes on.Ó 
Harry was so busy staring at Ma
lfoy, he did not notice Goyle 
reaching up for his trunk; as he 
swung it down, it hit Harry hard 
on the side of the head. He let ou
t an involuntary gasp of pain, and 
Malfoy looked up at th
e luggage rack, frowning. 
Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, 
but he still did not much like 
the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by 
a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Ey
es still watering and head still 
throbbing, he drew his wand, care
ful not to disarrange the cloak, 
and waited, breath held. To his reli
ef, Malfoy seemed to decide that 
he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, 
locked his trunk, and as the train 
slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened 
a thick new traveling cloak round his neck. 
Harry could see the corridors fill
ing up again and hoped that 
Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform 
for him; he was stuck where he 
was until the compartment had 
quite emptied. At last, with a fina
l lurch, the train came to a com-
plete halt. Goyle threw the door 
open and muscled his way out  
 &#'"")/01""!/02"
 ,63" into a crowd of second years, pu
nching them aside; Crabbe and 
Zabini followed. 
ÒYou go on,Ó Malfoy told Pans
y, who was waiting for him with 
her hand held out as though hoping
 he would hold it. ÒI just want 
to check something.Ó 
Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy
 were alone in the compart-
ment. People were filing past, de
scending onto the dark platform. 
Malfoy moved over to the co
mpartment door and let down the 
blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He 
then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. 
Harry peered down over the edge 
of the luggage rack, his heart 
pumping a little faster. What ha
d Malfoy wanted to hide from 
Pansy? Was he about to see the my
sterious broken object it was so 
important to mend? 
ÒPetrificus Totalus
!Ó Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was 
instantly paralyzed. As though in
 slow motion, he toppled out of 
the luggage rack and fell, with an 
agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at 
MalfoyÕs feet, the Invisibility 
Cloak trapped beneath him, his 
whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the 
cramped kneeling position. He coul
dnÕt move a muscle; he could 
only gaze up at
 Malfoy, who smiled broadly. 
ÒI thought so,Ó he said jubilantly. ÒI heard GoyleÕs trunk hit you. 
And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after 
Zabini came back. . . .Ó 
His eyes lingered for a mome
nt upon HarryÕs trainers. 
ÒYou didnÕt hear anything I care 
about, Potter. But while IÕve got 
you here . . .Ó 
 !#$%&'("")'*'+"
 ,65" And he stamped, hard, on HarryÕs 
face. Harry felt his nose break; 
blood spurted everywhere. 
ÒThatÕs from my father. Now, letÕs see. . . .Ó 
Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under HarryÕs immobilized 
body and threw it over him. 
ÒI donÕt reckon theyÕll find you ti
ll the trainÕs back in London,Ó 
he said quietly. ÒSee you ar
ound, Potter . . . or not.Ó 
And taking care to tread on Ha
rryÕs fingers, Malfoy left the 
compartment. !"#"$"%"&"'"(""'")"*"#"&"
""+,," -.$%'"/)!&0()01-"
   arry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the 
Invisibility Cloak feeling th
e blood from his nose flow, 
hot and wet, over his face, listenin
g to the voices and footsteps in 
the corridor beyond. His immediat
e thought was that someone, 
surely, would check the compartments before the train departed 
again. But at once came the disp
iriting realization that even if 
somebody looked into the compartm
ent, he would be neither seen 
nor heard. His best hope was th
at somebody else would walk in 
and step on him. 
Harry had never hated Malfoy more th
an as he lay there, like an 
absurd turtle on its back, blood dr
ipping sickeningly into his open 
mouth. What a stupid situation to 
have landed himself in . . . and 
now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling 
along the dark platform outside; 
he could hear the scraping of 
trunks and the loud babble of talk. 
Ron and Hermione would think 
that he had left the train 
#"!#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +,2" without them. Once they arrived at
 Hogwarts and took their places 
in the Great Hall, looked up an
d down the Gryffindor table a few 
times, and finally realized that 
he was not there, he, no doubt, 
would be halfway back to London. 
He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. 
Then he remembered that some wi
zards, like Dumbledore, could 
perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, 
which had fallen out of his 
hand, by saying the words Ò
Accio 
Wand
!Ó over and over again in hi
s head, but nothing happened. 
He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that sur-
rounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a 
search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping 
it) panicked voices wondering 
where Harry Potter had gone. A 
feeling of hopelessness spread thro
ugh him as he imagined the con-
voy of thestral-drawn carriages tr
undling up to the school and the 
muffled yells of laughter issuin
g from whichever carriage Malfoy 
was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to 
Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. 
The train lurched, causing Harry to
 roll over onto his side. Now 
he was staring at the du
sty underside of the seat
s instead of the ceil-
ing. The floor began to vibrate as 
the engine roared into life. The 
Express was leaving an
d nobody knew he wa
s still on it. . . . 
Then he felt his Invisibility Cl
oak fly off him and a voice over-
head said, ÒWotcher, Harry.Ó 
There was a flash of red light an
d HarryÕs body unfroze; he was 
able to push himself into a more 
dignified sitting position, hastily 
wipe the blood off his bruised face 
with the back of his hand, and 
raise his head to look up at Tonk
s, who was holding 
the Invisibility 
Cloak she had just pulled away. 
-.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +,3" ÒWeÕd better get out of here, quic
kly,Ó she said, as the train win-
dows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of 
the station. ÒCome on, weÕll jump.Ó 
Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the 
train door and leapt onto the platfo
rm, which seemed to be sliding 
underneath them as 
the train gathered momentum. He followed 
her, staggered a little on landing, 
then straightened up in time to 
see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the cor-
ner, and disappear from view. 
The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks 
was looking at him; he felt angry 
and embarrassed th
at he had been 
discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him 
back the Invisibility Cloak. 
ÒWho did it?Ó 
ÒDraco Malfoy,Ó said Harry bitterl
y. ÒThanks for . . . well . . .Ó 
ÒNo problem,Ó said Tonks, with
out smiling. From what Harry 
could see in the darkness, she wa
s as mousy-haired and miserable-
looking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. ÒI can 
fix your nose if you stand still.Ó 
Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to 
visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more 
confidence when it came 
to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to 
say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes. 
ÒEpiskey,Ó said Tonks. 
HarryÕs nose felt very hot, and th
en very cold. He raised a hand 
and felt it gingerly. It
 seemed to be mended. 
ÒThanks a lot!Ó 
ÒYouÕd better put that cloak back 
on, and we can walk up to the 
school,Ó said Tonks, still unsmilin
g. As Harry swung the cloak back 
!#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +,4" over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged 
creature erupted from
 it and streaked off into the darkness. 
ÒWas that a Patronus?Ó asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore 
send messages like this. 
ÒYes, IÕm sending word to the castle that IÕve got you or theyÕll 
worry. Come on, weÕd better not dawdle.Ó 
They set off toward the lane
 that led to
 the school. 
ÒHow did you find me?Ó 
ÒI noticed you hadnÕt left the 
train and I knew you had that 
cloak. I thought you might be hid
ing for some reason. When I saw 
the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought IÕd 
check.Ó 
ÒBut what are you doing he
re, anyway?Ó Harry asked. 
ÒIÕm stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra pro-
tection,Ó said Tonks. 
ÒIs it just you whoÕs stationed up here, or Ñ ?Ó 
ÒNo, Proudfoot, Savage, an
d Dawlish are here too.Ó 
ÒDawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?Ó 
ÒThatÕs right.Ó 
They trudged up the dark, desert
ed lane, following the freshly 
made carriage tracks. Harry looked
 sideways at Tonks under his 
cloak. Last year she had been inquis
itive (to the point of being a lit-
tle annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. 
Now she seemed older and much 
more serious and purposeful. 
Was this all the effect of what ha
d happened at the Ministry? He re-
flected uncomfortably that Hermio
ne would have suggested he say 
something consoling about Sirius to
 her, that it hadnÕt been her 
fault at all, but he co
uldnÕt bring himself to do it. He was far from 
blaming her for SiriusÕs death; it 
was no more her fault than anyone 
-.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +,5" elseÕs (and much less than his), 
but he did not like talking about 
Sirius if he could avoid it. And 
so they tramped on through the 
cold night in silence, TonksÕs long
 cloak whispering on the ground 
behind them. 
Having always traveled there by 
carriage, Harry had never before 
appreciated just how far Hogwarts
 was from Hogsmeade Station. 
With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the 
gates, each topped with a winged
 boar. He was cold, he was hun-
gry, and he was quite keen to le
ave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. 
But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them 
chained shut. 
ÒAlohomora!Ó he said confidently, pointing his wand at the pad-
lock, but nothing happened. 
ÒThat wonÕt work on these,Ó said Tonks. ÒDumbledore bewitched 
them himself.Ó 
Harry looked around. 
ÒI could climb a wall,Ó he suggested. 
ÒNo, you couldnÕt,Ó said Tonks flat
ly. ÒAnti-intruder jinxes on all 
of them. SecurityÕs been tightened a hundredfold this summer.Ó 
ÒWell then,Ó said Harry, starting 
to feel annoyed at her lack of 
helpfulness, ÒI suppose IÕll just ha
ve to sleep out here and wait for 
morning.Ó 
ÒSomeoneÕs coming down for 
you,Ó said Tonks. ÒLook.Ó 
A lantern was bobbing at the dist
ant foot of the castle. Harry 
was so pleased to see it
 he felt he could even
 endure FilchÕs wheezy 
criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping 
would improve with the 
regular applicat
ion of thumbscrews. It was 
not until the glowing yellow ligh
t was ten feet away from them, 
and Harry had pulled off his Invisibi
lity Cloak so that he could be 
!#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +26" seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit 
hooked nose and long, black, gr
easy hair of Severus Snape. 
ÒWell, well, well,Ó sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tap-
ping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the 
gates creaked open. ÒNice of you to
 turn up, Potter, although you 
have evidently decided that the we
aring of school robes would de-
tract from your appearance.Ó 
ÒI couldnÕt change, I 
didnÕt have my ÑÓ Harry began, but Snape 
cut across him. 
ÒThere is no need 
to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite Ñ 
ah Ñ safe in my hands.Ó 
ÒI meant Hagrid to get the me
ssage,Ó said Tonks, frowning. 
ÒHagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, 
so I took it instead. 
And incidentally,Ó said 
Snape, standing back 
to allow Harry to pass him, ÒI was interested to see your new 
Patronus.Ó 
He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the 
chains with his wand again, so th
at they slithered, clinking, back 
into place. 
ÒI think you were better off with the old one,Ó said Snape, the 
malice in his voice unmistakab
le. ÒThe new one looks weak.Ó 
As Snape swung the lantern about,
 Harry saw, fleetingly, a look 
of shock and anger on 
TonksÕs face. Then she 
was covered in dark-
ness once more. 
ÒGood night,Ó Harry called to her ov
er his shoulder, as he began 
the walk up to the scho
ol with Snape. ÒThanks for . . . everything.Ó 
ÒSee you, Harry.Ó 
Snape did not speak for a minute 
or so. Harry felt as though his 
body was generating waves of hatred
 so powerful that it seemed 
-.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +2+" incredible that Snape could not 
feel them burning him. He had 
loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed him-
self forever and irrevocably beyo
nd the possibility of HarryÕs for-
giveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, 
Harry had had time to think over
 the summer, and had concluded 
that SnapeÕs snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden 
while the rest of the Order of th
e Phoenix were off fighting Volde-
mort had probably been 
a powerful factor in 
Sirius rushing off to 
the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, 
because it enabled him to blame Sn
ape, which felt satisfying, and 
also because he knew 
that if anyone was not 
sorry that Sirius was 
dead, it was the man now striding
 next to him in the darkness. 
ÒFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,Ó said Snape. 
ÒAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, 
I donÕt believe any House has ever b
een in negative figures this early 
in the term: We havenÕt even star
ted pudding. You might have set a 
record, Potter.Ó 
The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze 
white-hot, but he would rather 
have been immobilized all the way 
back to London than tell Snape why he was late. 
ÒI suppose you wanted to make
 an entrance, did you?Ó Snape 
continued. ÒAnd with no flying car available you decided that 
bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to 
create a dramatic effect.Ó 
Still Harry remained silent, thou
gh he thought his chest might 
explode. He knew that Snape had 
come to fetch him for this, for 
the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without 
anyone else listening. 
They reached the castle steps at 
last and as the great oaken front 
!#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +27" doors swung open into the vast flagge
d entrance hall, a burst of talk 
and laughter and of 
tinkling plates and glasses greeted them 
through the doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry won-
dered whether he could slip his In
visibility Cloak back on, thereby 
gaining his seat at the long Gr
yffindor table (which, inconve-
niently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being 
noticed. As though he had read 
HarryÕs mind, however, Snape said, 
ÒNo cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is 
what you wanted, IÕm sure.Ó 
Harry turned on the spot and 
marched straight through the 
open doors: anything to get away
 from Snape. The Great Hall, 
with its four long House tables an
d its staff table set at the top of 
the room, was decorated as usual wi
th floating candles that made 
the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to 
Harry, however, who walked so fa
st that he was passing the Huf-
flepuff table before people really 
started to stare, and by the time 
they were standing up to get a 
good look at him, he had spotted 
Ron and Hermione, sped along 
the benches toward them, and 
forced his way in between them. 
ÒWhereÕve you Ñ blimey, whatÕve 
you done to your face?Ó said 
Ron, goggling at him along with 
everyone else in the vicinity. 
ÒWhy, whatÕs wrong with it?Ó sa
id Harry, grabbing a spoon and 
squinting at his distorted reflection. 
ÒYouÕre covered in 
blood!Ó said Hermione. ÒCome here ÑÓ 
She raised her wand, said Ò
Tergeo
!Ó and siphoned off the dried 
blood. ÒThanks,Ó said Harry, feeling his
 now clean face. ÒHowÕs my 
nose looking?Ó 
 -.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +28" ÒNormal,Ó said Hermione anxiously. ÒWhy shouldnÕt it? Harry, 
what happened? WeÕv
e been terrified!Ó 
ÒIÕll tell you later,Ó said Harry cu
rtly. He was very conscious that 
Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus 
were listening in; even Nearly 
Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghos
t, had come floating along the 
bench to eavesdrop. 
ÒBut ÑÓ said Hermione. 
ÒNot now, Hermione,Ó said Harry, 
in a darkly sign
ificant voice. 
He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been in-
volved in something heroic, prefer
ably involving a couple of Death 
Eaters and a dementor. Of course, 
Malfoy would spread the story as 
far and wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldnÕt 
reach too many Gr
yffindor ears. 
He reached across Ron for a coup
le of chicken legs and a hand-
ful of chips, but before he could ta
ke them they vanished, to be re-
placed with puddings. 
ÒYou missed the Sorting, anyway,Ó said Hermione, as Ron dived 
for a large chocolate gateau. 
ÒHat say anything interesting?Ó 
asked Harry, taking a piece of 
treacle tart. 
ÒMore of the same, really . . . advi
sing us all to unite in the face 
of our enemies, you know.Ó 
ÒDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?Ó 
ÒNot yet, but he always saves 
his proper speech for after the 
feast, doesnÕt he? It canÕt be long now.Ó 
ÒSnape said Hagrid was late for the feast ÑÓ 
ÒYouÕve seen Snape? How come?Ó said Ron between frenzied 
mouthfuls of gateau. 
 !#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +29" ÒBumped into him,Ó said Harry evasively. 
ÒHagrid was only a few minutes 
late,Ó said Hermione. ÒLook, 
heÕs waving at you, Harry.Ó 
Harry looked up at the staff ta
ble and grinned at Hagrid, who 
was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to 
comport himself with 
the dignity of Profes
sor McGonagall, Head 
of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere 
between HagridÕs elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by 
side, and who was lookin
g disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greet-
ing. Harry was surprised to see th
e Divination teacher, Professor 
Trelawney, sitting on HagridÕs othe
r side; she rarely left her tower 
room, and he had never seen her at
 the start-of-term feast before. 
She looked as odd as ever, glittering
 with beads and 
trailing shawls, 
her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having al-
ways considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to 
discover at the end of the previous
 term that it had been she who 
had made the predicti
on that caused Lord Voldemort to kill 
HarryÕs parents and 
attack Harry himself
. The knowledge had 
made him even less eager to find himself in her company, but 
thankfully, this year he would be
 dropping Divina
tion. Her great 
beaconlike eyes swiveled in his dire
ction; he hastily looked away to-
ward the Slytherin table. Draco Ma
lfoy was miming the shattering 
of a nose to raucous laughter an
d applause. Harry dropped his gaze 
to his treacle tart, his insides bu
rning again. What he would not 
give to fight Malfoy
 one-on-one . . . 
ÒSo what did Profes
sor Slughorn want?Ó Hermione asked. 
ÒTo know what really
 happened at the Mi
nistry,Ó said Harry. 
ÒHim and everyone else here,Ó sniffed Hermione. ÒPeople were 
interrogating us about it on the train, werenÕt they, Ron?Ó 
-.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +2," ÒYeah,Ó said Ron. ÒAll wanting to know if you really are Ôthe 
Chosen OneÕ ÑÓ 
ÒThere has been much talk on 
that very subject even amongst 
the ghosts,Ó interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely 
connected head toward Harry so that
 it wobbled dangerously on its 
ruff. ÒI am considered something of 
a Potter authority; it is widely 
known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community 
that I will not pester you for info
rmation, however. ÔHarry Potter 
knows that he can confide in me wi
th complete confidence,Õ I told 
them. ÔI would rather die 
than betray his trust.ÕÓ 
ÒThatÕs not saying much, seeing 
as youÕre already dead,Ó Ron 
observed. ÒOnce again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,Ó said 
Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air 
and glided back toward the far end 
of the Gryffindor table just as 
Dumbledore got to his feet at the st
aff table. The talk and laughter 
echoing around the Hall died
 away almost instantly. 
ÒThe very best of evenings to yo
u!Ó he said, smiling broadly, his 
arms opened wide as though
 to embrace the whole room. 
ÒWhat happened to his ha
nd?Ó gasped Hermione. 
She was not the only one who had noticed. DumbledoreÕs right 
hand was as blackened and dead-l
ooking as it had been on the 
night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers 
swept the room; Dumbledore, interp
reting them correctly, merely 
smiled and shook his purple-and
-gold sleeve over his injury. ÒNothing to worry about,Ó he said
 airily. ÒNow . . . to our new 
students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another 
year full of magical educ
ation awaits you . . .Ó 
ÒHis hand was like that wh
en I saw him over the summer,Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +22" Harry whispered to Hermione. ÒI 
thought heÕd have cured it by 
now, though . . . or Mada
m Pomfrey wouldÕve done.Ó 
ÒIt looks as if itÕs died,Ó said 
Hermione, with a nauseated expres-
sion. ÒBut there are some injuries you canÕt cure . . . old curses . . . 
and there are poisons wi
thout antidotes. . . .Ó Ò. . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker,
 has asked me to say that there 
is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called 
WeasleysÕ Wiza
rd Wheezes. 
ÒThose wishing to play for thei
r House Quidditch teams should 
give their names to their Heads of 
House as usual. We
 are also look-
ing for new Quidditch commenta
tors, who should do likewise. 
ÒWe are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. 
Professor SlughornÓ Ñ Slughorn st
ood up, his bald head gleaming 
in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table below 
into shadow Ñ Òis a former colleague of mine who has agreed to 
resume his old post 
of Potions master.Ó 
ÒPotions?Ó 
ÒPotions
?Ó The word echoed all over the Ha
ll as people wondered whether 
they had heard right. 
ÒPotions?Ó said Ron and Hermione 
together, turning to stare at 
Harry. ÒBut you said ÑÓ 
ÒProfessor Snape, meanwhile,Ó said Dumbledore, raising his 
voice so that it carried over all th
e muttering, Òwill be taking over 
the position of Defense Agai
nst the Dark Arts teacher.Ó ÒNo!Ó said Harry, so loudly that 
many heads turned in his direc-
tion. He did not care; he was starin
g up at the staff table, incensed. 
How could Snape be given the Defen
se Against the Dark Arts job  
 -.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +23" after all this time? HadnÕt it been widely known for years that 
Dumbledore did not trust him to do it? 
ÒBut Harry, you said that Slugho
rn was going to be teaching De-
fense Against the Dark 
Arts!Ó said Hermione. 
ÒI thought he was!Ó said Harry, 
racking his brains
 to remember 
when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to 
think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him 
what Slughorn would be teaching. 
Snape, who was sitting on Dumble
doreÕs right, did not stand up 
at the mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy ac-
knowledgment of the applause fr
om the Slytherin table, yet Harry 
was sure he could detect a look 
of triumph on the features he 
loathed so much. 
ÒWell, thereÕs one good thing,Ó he
 said savagely. ÒSnapeÕll be 
gone by the end 
of the year.Ó 
ÒWhat do you mean?Ó asked Ron. 
ÒThat jobÕs jinxed. No o
neÕs lasted more than a year. . . . Quirrell 
actually died doing it. . . . Person
ally, IÕm going to keep my fingers 
crossed for another death. . . .Ó 
ÒHarry!Ó said Hermione, 
shocked and reproachful. 
ÒHe might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the 
year,Ó said Ron reasonably. ÒTha
t Slughorn bloke might not want 
to stay long-term. Moody didnÕt.Ó 
Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were 
not the only ones who had been ta
lking; the whole Hall had erupted 
in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved 
his heartÕs desire. Seemingly oblivi
ous to the sensational nature of 
the news he had just imparted, Du
mbledore said nothing more  
 !#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +24" about staff appointments, but wait
ed a few seconds to ensure that 
the silence was absolute
 before continuing. 
ÒNow, as everybody in this Hall 
knows, Lord Voldemort and his 
followers are once more at la
rge and gaining in strength.Ó 
The silence seemed to tauten an
d strain as Dumbledore spoke. 
Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, 
but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he 
found the headmasterÕs words 
unworthy of his attention. 
ÒI cannot emphasize strongly 
enough how dangerous the present 
situation is, and how much care each
 of us at Hogwarts must take 
to ensure that we remain safe. Th
e castleÕs magical fortifications 
have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new 
and more powerful ways, but we 
must still guard scrupulously 
against carelessness on the part of 
any student or member of staff. 
I urge you, therefore, to abide by 
any security restrictions that your 
teachers might impose upon you,
 however irksome you might find 
them Ñ in particular, the rule that
 you are not to be out of bed af-
ter hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or 
suspicious within or outside the cast
le, to report it to a member of 
staff immediately. I trust you to 
conduct yourselves, always, with 
the utmost regard for your
 own and othersÕ safety.Ó DumbledoreÕs blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled 
once more. 
ÒBut now, your beds await, as
 warm and comfortable as you 
could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-
rested for your lessons tomorrow. 
Let us therefore say good night. 
Pip pip!Ó 
With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches were 
moved back and the hundreds of st
udents began to file out of the 
-.$%'""/)!&0()01-"
 +25" Great Hall toward their dormitori
es. Harry, who wa
s in no hurry 
at all to leave with the gawping 
crowd, nor to get near enough to 
Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged 
behind, pretending to retie the lace 
on his trainer, allowing most of 
the Gryffindors to draw ahead of
 him. Hermione had darted ahead 
to fulfill her prefectÕs duty of sh
epherding the first years, but Ron 
remained with Harry. 
ÒWhat really happened to your nose?Ó he asked, once they were 
at the very back of the throng pre
ssing out of the Hall, and out of 
earshot of anyone else. 
Harry told him. It was a mark of th
e strength of their friendship 
that Ron did not laugh. 
ÒI saw Malfoy miming something 
to do with a nose,Ó he said 
darkly. ÒYeah, well, never mind that,Ó 
said Harry bitterly. ÒListen to 
what he was saying before he found out I was there. . . .Ó 
Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by MalfoyÕs boasts. With 
what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was 
unimpressed. ÒCome on, Harry, he was just sh
owing off for Parkinson. . . . 
What kind of mission would Yo
u-Know-Who have given him?Ó 
ÒHow dÕyou know Voldemort do
esnÕt need someone at Hog-
warts? It wouldnÕt
 be the first ÑÓ 
ÒI wish yehÕd stop sayinÕ thaÕ name, Harry,Ó said a reproachful 
voice behind them. Harry looked over
 his shoulder to see Hagrid 
shaking his head. 
ÒDumbledore uses that name,Ó said Harry stubbornly. 
ÒYeah, well, thaÕs Dumbledore, innit?Ó said Hagrid mysteriously. 
ÒSo how come yeh were late
, Harry? I was worried.Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&"
 +36" ÒGot held up on the train,Ó said Harry. ÒWhy were 
you late?Ó 
ÒI was with Grawp,Ó said Hagrid 
happily. ÒLosÕ track oÕ the time. 
HeÕs got a new home up in the 
mountains now, Dumbledore fixed 
it Ñ nice big cave. HeÕs much ha
ppier than he was in the forest. 
We were havinÕ 
a good chat.Ó 
ÒReally?Ó said Harry, taking care 
not to catch RonÕs eye; the last 
time he had met HagridÕs half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent 
for ripping up trees by the roots, 
his vocabulary had comprised five 
words, two of which he was un
able to pronounce properly. 
ÒOh yeah, heÕs really come on,Ó said Hagrid proudly. ÒYehÕll be 
amazed. IÕm thinkinÕ oÕ traininÕ him up as me assistant.Ó 
Ron snorted loudly, but managed 
to pass it off as a violent 
sneeze. They were now standing
 beside the oa
k front doors. 
ÒAnyway, IÕll see yeh tomorrow, firs
Õ lessonÕs straight
 after lunch. 
Come early anÕ yeh can say hello 
ter Buck Ñ I mean, Witherwings!Ó 
Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the front 
doors into the darkness. 
Harry and Ron looked at each ot
her. Harry could tell that Ron 
was experiencing the same si
nking feeling as himself. 
ÒYouÕre not taking Care of 
Magical Creature
s, are you?Ó 
Ron shook his head. ÒAnd yo
uÕre not either, are you?Ó 
Harry shook his head too. 
ÒAnd Hermione,Ó said Ron, ÒsheÕs not, is she?Ó 
Harry shook his head again. Ex
actly what Hagrid would say 
when he realized his three favori
te students had given up his sub-
ject, he did not like to think. 
!"#"$"%"&"'"("")"*")"'"
""+,+" &#'"#$-./0-112"%(*)!'"
   arry and Ron met Hermione 
in the common room be-
fore breakfast next morning. 
Hoping for some support for 
his theory, Harry lost no time in
 telling Hermione what he had 
overheard Malfoy 
saying on the Hogwarts Express. 
ÒBut he was obviously showing off 
for Parkinson, wasnÕt he?Ó in-
terjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything. 
ÒWell,Ó she said uncertai
nly, ÒI donÕt know. . 
. . It would be like 
Malfoy to make himself seem more
 important than he is . . . but 
thatÕs a big lie 
to tell. . . .Ó 
ÒExactly,Ó said Harry, but he co
uld not press the point, because 
so many people were trying to li
sten in to his conversation, not to 
mention staring at him
 and whispering behind their hands. 
ÒItÕs rude to point,Ó Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule 
first-year boy as they joined the 
queue to climb out of the portrait 
hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry  
 #"!#$%&'("")*)'"
 +,3" behind his hand to his friend, pr
omptly turned scarlet and toppled 
out of the hole in al
arm. Ron sniggered. 
ÒI love being a sixth year. 
And weÕre going to be getting free time 
this year. Whole periods
 when we can just sit up here and relax.Ó 
ÒWeÕre going to need that time 
for studying, Ron!Ó said Hermi-
one, as they set off down the corridor. 
ÒYeah, but not today,Ó said Ron. ÒT
odayÕs going to be a real doss, 
I reckon.Ó ÒHold it!Ó said Hermione, thro
wing out an arm and halting a 
passing fourth year, who was attemp
ting to push past her with a 
lime-green disk clutched tightly in
 his hand. ÒFanged Frisbees are 
banned, hand it over,Ó she told
 him sternly. The scowling boy 
handed over the snarling Frisbee,
 ducked under her arm, and took 
off after his friends. Ron waited 
for him to vanish, then tugged the 
Frisbee from HermioneÕs grip. 
ÒExcellent, IÕve always 
wanted one of these.Ó 
HermioneÕs remonstration was dr
owned by a loud giggle; Laven-
der Brown had apparently found Ro
nÕs remark highly amusing. She 
continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over 
her shoulder. Ron looked rath
er pleased with himself. 
The ceiling of the Great Hall wa
s serenely blue and streaked 
with frail, wispy clouds, just like
 the squares of sk
y visible through 
the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and 
eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron to
ld Hermione about their embar-
rassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening. 
ÒBut he canÕt really think weÕd continue Care of Magical Crea-
tures!Ó she said, looking distressed.
 ÒI mean, when has any of us ex-
pressed . . . you know 
. . . any enthusiasm?Ó ÒThatÕs it, though, innit?Ó said 
Ron, swallowing an entire fried 
&#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +,4" egg whole. ÒWe were the ones who 
made the most effort in classes 
because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid 
subject. DÕyou reckon anyoneÕs going 
to go on to N.E.W.T.?Ó 
Neither Harry nor Hermione an
swered; there was no need. 
They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to 
continue Care of Magical Creatu
res. They avoided HagridÕs eye 
and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the 
staff table ten minutes later. 
After they had eaten, they rema
ined in their places, awaiting 
Professor McGonagallÕs descent from
 the staff table. The distribu-
tion of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, 
for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody 
had achieved the necessary O.W.L. 
grades to continue with their 
chosen N.E.W.T.s. 
Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, 
Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Poti
ons, and shot off to a first-
period Ancient Runes cla
ss without further ado.
 Neville took a lit-
tle longer to sort out; his roun
d face was anxious as Professor 
McGonagall looked down his appl
ication and then consulted his 
O.W.L. results. 
ÒHerbology, fine,Ó she said. ÒProfe
ssor Sprout will be delighted 
to see you back with an ÔOutstan
dingÕ O.W.L. And you qualify for 
Defense Against the Dark Arts with
 ÔExceeds Expectations.Õ But the 
problem is Transfiguration. 
IÕm sorry, Longbottom, but an 
AcceptableÕ really isnÕt good enough 
to continue to N.E.W.T level. 
I just donÕt think youÕ
d be able to cope with the coursework.Ó 
Neville hung his head. Professo
r McGonagall peered at him 
through her square spectacles. 
!#$%&'("")*)'"
 +,5" ÒWhy do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? 
IÕve never had the impr
ession that you particularly enjoyed it.Ó 
Neville looked miserable and 
muttered something about Òmy 
grandmother wants.Ó 
ÒHmph,Ó snorted Professor McGonagall. ÒItÕs high time your 
grandmother learned to 
be proud of the grands
on sheÕs got, rather 
than the one she thinks she ough
t to have Ñ particularly after 
what happened at the Ministry.Ó 
Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor 
McGonagall had never paid 
him a compliment before. 
ÒIÕm sorry, Longbottom, but I ca
nnot let you into my N.E.W.T. 
class. I see that you have an ÔExceeds ExpectationsÕ in Charms, 
however Ñ why not try for 
a N.E.W.T. in Charms?Ó 
ÒMy grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,Ó mumbled 
Neville. ÒTake Charms,Ó said Professor 
McGonagall, Òand I shall drop 
Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed 
her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.Ó Smiling 
slightly at the look of delighted in
credulity on NevilleÕs face, Profes-
sor McGonagall tapped a blank sche
dule with the tip of her wand 
and handed it, now carrying detail
s of his new classes, to Neville. 
Professor McGonagall turned next
 to Parvati Patil, whose first 
question was whether Firenze, th
e handsome centaur, was still 
teaching Divination. 
ÒHe and Professor Trelawney are 
dividing classes between them 
this year,Ó said Professor McGona
gall, a hint of disapproval in her 
voice; it was common knowledge th
at she despised the subject of 
Divination. ÒThe sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.Ó 
 &#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +,6" Parvati set off for Divination five
 minutes later looking slightly 
crestfallen. 
ÒSo, Potter, Potter . . .Ó said Professor McGonagall, consulting 
her notes as she turned to Ha
rry. ÒCharms, Defense Against the 
Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguratio
n . . . all fine. I must say, I was 
pleased with your Transfiguration 
mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, 
why havenÕt you applied to continue
 with Potions? 
I thought it was 
your ambition to 
become an Auror?Ó 
ÒIt was, but you told me I had 
to get an ÔOutstandingÕ in my 
O.W.L., Professor.Ó 
ÒAnd so you did when Professor 
Snape was teaching the subject. 
Professor Slughorn, however, is pe
rfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T 
students with ÔExceeds Expectatio
nsÕ at O.W.L. Do you wish to 
proceed with Potions?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry, Òbut I didnÕt 
buy the books or 
any ingredients 
or anything ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm sure Professor Slughorn will be
 able to lend you some,Ó said 
Professor McGonagall. ÒVery well, 
Potter, here is your schedule. 
Oh, by the way Ñ twenty hopefuls have already put down their 
names for the Gryffindor Quidditc
h team. I shall pa
ss the list to 
you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.Ó 
A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as 
Harry, and the two of them
 left the table together. 
ÒLook,Ó said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, ÒweÕve got 
a free period now . . . and a free
 period after brea
k . . . and after 
lunch . . . 
excellent!Ó They returned to the common room, which was empty apart 
from a half dozen seventh years, 
including Katie Bell, the only  
 !#$%&'("")*)'"
 +,7" remaining member of the original 
Gryffindor Quidditch team that 
Harry had joined in
 his first year. 
ÒI thought youÕd get th
at, well done,Ó she called over, pointing 
at the CaptainÕs badge on HarryÕs
 chest. ÒTell me when you call 
trials!Ó 
ÒDonÕt be stupid,Ó said Harry, 
Òyou donÕt need to try out, IÕve 
watched you play for five years. . . .Ó 
ÒYou mustnÕt start off like that,Ó she said warningly. ÒFor all you 
know, thereÕs someone much better
 than me out there. Good teams 
have been ruined before now beca
use Captains just kept playing 
the old faces, or letting 
in their friends. . . .Ó 
Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the 
Fanged Frisbee Hermione had take
n from the fourth-year student. 
It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to 
take bites of the tapestry. Crookshan
ksÕs yellow eyes followed it and 
he hissed when it
 came too close. 
An hour later they reluctantly 
left the sunlit common room for 
the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. 
Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of 
heavy books and looking put-upon. 
ÒWe got so much homework for Runes,Ó she said anxiously, 
when Harry and Ron joined her. ÒA 
fifteen-inch essay, two transla-
tions, and IÕve got to read these by Wednesday!Ó 
ÒShame,Ó yawned Ron. 
ÒYou wait,Ó she said resentfully. ÒI bet Snape gives us loads.Ó 
The classroom door opened as 
she spoke, and 
Snape stepped 
into the corridor, his sallow face fram
ed as ever by two curtains of 
greasy black hair. Silence fell 
over the queue immediately. 
ÒInside,Ó he said. 
&#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +,," Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his 
personality upon the room already;
 it was gloomier than usual, as 
curtains had been drawn over the 
windows, and was lit by candle-
light. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing peo-
ple who appeared to be in pain, spor
ting grisly injuries or strangely 
contorted body parts. Nobody spok
e as they settled down, looking 
around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures. 
ÒI have not asked you to take ou
t your books,Ó said Snape, clos-
ing the door and moving to face 
the class from behind his desk; 
Hermione hastily dropped her copy of 
Confronting the Faceless
 back 
into her bag and stowed it under her 
chair. ÒI wish to speak to you, 
and I want your fullest attention.Ó 
His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a 
fraction of a second longer on HarryÕs than anyone elseÕs. 
ÒYou have had five teachers in 
this subject so far, I believe.Ó 
You believe . . . like you havenÕt watched them all come and go, 
Snape, hoping youÕd be next,
 thought Harry scathingly. 
ÒNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods 
and priorities. Given this confusio
n I am surprised so many of you 
scraped an O.W.L. in this subject.
 I shall be even more surprised if 
all of you manage to keep up wi
th the N.E.W.T. work, which will 
be much more advanced.Ó 
Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a 
lower voice; the class craned th
eir necks to keep him in view. 
ÒThe Dark Arts,Ó said Snape, Òa
re many, varied, ever-changing, 
and eternal. Fighting them is like
 fighting a many-headed monster, 
which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and 
cleverer than before. You are fighti
ng that which is unfixed, mutat-
ing, indestructible.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*)'"
 +,8" Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the 
Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy,
 another to speak of them, as 
Snape was doing, with a lovi
ng caress in his voice? 
ÒYour defenses,Ó said Snape, a lit
tle louder, Òmust therefore be as 
flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These picturesÓ 
Ñ he indicated a few of them as 
he swept past Ñ Ògive a fair rep-
resentation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the 
Cruciatus CurseÓ Ñ he waved a 
hand toward a witch who was 
clearly shrieking in agony Ñ Òfeel
 the DementorÕs KissÓ Ñ a wiz-
ard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall Ñ Òor 
provoke the aggression of the I
nferiusÓ Ñ a bloody mass upon the 
ground. 
ÒHas an Inferius been seen, then?Ó
 said Parvati Pa
til in a high-
pitched voice. ÒIs 
it definite, is he using them?Ó 
ÒThe Dark Lord has used Inferi in
 the past,Ó said Snape, Òwhich 
means you would be well-advised 
to assume he might use them 
again. Now . . .Ó He set off again around the othe
r side of the classroom toward 
his desk, and again, they watched 
him as he walked, his dark robes 
billowing behind him. 
Ò. . . you are, I believe, complete
 novices in the use of nonverbal 
spells. What is the advant
age of a nonverbal spell?Ó 
HermioneÕs hand shot into the ai
r. Snape took his time looking 
around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before 
saying curtly, ÒVery well Ñ Miss Granger?Ó 
ÒYour adversary has no warning about what kind of magic youÕre 
about to perform,Ó said Hermione
, Òwhich gives you a split-second 
advantage.Ó 
ÒAn answer copied almost
 word for word from 
The Standard Book
 &#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +,9" of Spells, Grade Six,
Ó said Snape dismissively
 (over in the corner, 
Malfoy sniggered), Òbut correct in 
essentials. Yes, those who progress 
to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of 
surprise in their spell-casting. No
t all wizards can do this, of course; 
it is a question of concentration and mind power which someÓ Ñ 
his gaze lingered maliciously up
on Harry once more Ñ Òlack.Ó 
Harry knew Snape was 
thinking of their disastrous Occlumency 
lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glow-
ered at Snape until Snape looked away. 
ÒYou will now divide,Ó Snape went
 on, Òinto pairs. One partner 
will attempt to jinx the other 
without speaking.
 The other will at-
tempt to repel the jinx 
in equal silence.
 Carry on.Ó 
Although Snape did not know it, 
Harry had taught at least half 
the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to 
perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever 
cast the charm without speaking, ho
wever. A reasonable amount of 
cheating ensued; many people 
were merely whispering the 
incantation instead of saying it al
oud. Typically, ten minutes into 
the lesson Hermione managed to 
repel NevilleÕs muttered Jelly-
Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely 
have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable 
teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He 
swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like 
an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron strug-
gling with 
the task. 
Ron, who was supposed to be ji
nxing Harry, was purple in the 
face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation 
of muttering the incantation. Ha
rry had his wand raised, waiting 
on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come. 
!#$%&'("")*)'"
 +8:" ÒPathetic, Weasley,Ó said Snape,
 after a while. ÒHere Ñ let me 
show you ÑÓ 
He turned his wand on Harry so 
fast that Harry reacted instinc-
tively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, Ò
Protego!Ó His Shield Charm was so strong
 Snape was knocked off-balance 
and hit a desk. The whole clas
s had looked around and now 
watched as Snape righte
d himself, scowling. 
ÒDo you remember me telling you we are practicing 
nonverbal
 spells, Potter?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry stiffly. 
ÒYes, 
sir.Ó ÒThereÕs no need to call
 me Ôsir,Õ Professor.Ó 
The words had escaped him before 
he knew what he was saying. 
Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, how-
ever, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively. 
ÒDetention, Saturday night, my 
office,Ó said Snape. ÒI do not 
take cheek from anyone, 
Potter . . . not even Ô
the Chosen One.
ÕÓ 
ÒThat was brilliant, Ha
rry!Ó chortled Ron, once they were safely 
on their way to break a short while later. 
ÒYou really shouldnÕt have said 
it,Ó said Hermione, frowning at 
Ron. ÒWhat made you?Ó 
ÒHe tried to jinx me, in case yo
u didnÕt notice!Ó fumed Harry. ÒI 
had enough of that during those 
Occlumency lessons! Why doesnÕt 
he use another guinea pig for a ch
ange? WhatÕs Dumbledore playing 
at, anyway, letting him teach D
efense? Did you hear him talking 
about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that 
unfixed, indestructible
 stuff ÑÓ ÒWell,Ó said Hermione, ÒI though
t he sounded a bit like you.Ó 
ÒLike 
me?Ó &#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +8+" ÒYes, when you were telling us what itÕs like to face Voldemort. 
You said it wasnÕt just
 memorizing a bunch of 
spells, you said it was 
just you and your brains and your guts Ñ well, wasnÕt that what 
Snape was saying? That it really
 comes down to being brave and 
quick-thinking?Ó 
Harry was so disarmed that she 
had thought his words as well 
worth memorizing as 
The Standard Book of Spells
 that he did not 
argue. 
ÒHarry! Hey, Harry!Ó 
Harry looked around; Jack Sloper
, one of the Beaters on last 
yearÕs Gryffindor Quidditch team
, was hurrying toward him hold-
ing a roll of parchment. 
ÒFor you,Ó panted Sloper. ÒList
en, I heard youÕre the new Cap-
tain. WhenÕre you holding trials?Ó 
ÒIÕm not sure yet,Ó said Harry, 
thinking privately that Sloper 
would be very lucky to 
get back on the team. 
ÒIÕll let you know.Ó 
ÒOh, right. I was hoping itÕd be this weekend ÑÓ 
But Harry was not listening; he ha
d just recognized the thin, 
slanting writing on the parchment.
 Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, 
he hurried away with Ron and He
rmione, unrolling the parchment 
as he went.  
Dear Harry,
 I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. 
Kindly come along to my office at 8 
P.M. I hope you are enjoy-
ing your first day back at school.
 Yours sincerely,
 !"#$%&'$(#")*+,)&
P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
 !#$%&'("")*)'"
 +83" ÒHe enjoys Acid Pops?Ó said Ron,
 who had read the message over 
HarryÕs shoulder and was looking perplexed. 
ÒItÕs the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,Ó said 
Harry in a low voice. ÒHa! SnapeÕs 
not going to be pleased. . . . I 
wonÕt be able to 
do his detention!Ó 
He, Ron, and Hermione spent th
e whole of break speculating 
on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most 
likely to be spectacular jinxes 
and hexes of the 
type the Death 
Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, 
and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach 
Harry advanced Defensive magic. 
After break, she went off to 
Arithmancy while Harry and Ron 
returned to the common room, 
where they grudgingly started SnapeÕs homework. This turned out 
to be so complex that they stil
l had not finished when Hermione 
joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she consider-
ably speeded up the process). They 
had only just finished when the 
bell rang for the afternoonÕs doubl
e Potions and they beat the fa-
miliar path down to the dungeon cl
assroom that had, for so long, 
been SnapeÕs. 
When they arrived in the corridor
 they saw that 
there were only 
a dozen people progressing to N.E.
W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle 
had evidently failed to achieve the 
required O.W.L. grade, but four 
Slytherins had made 
it through, includin
g Malfoy. Four Raven-
claws were there, and one Huff
lepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom 
Harry liked despite his 
rather pompous manner. 
ÒHarry,Ó Ernie said portentously,
 holding out his
 hand as Harry 
approached, ÒdidnÕt get a chance 
to speak in Defense Against the 
Dark Arts this morning. Good le
sson, I thought, but Shield  
 &#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +84" Charms are old hat, of course, for 
us old D.A. lags . . . And how are 
you, Ron Ñ Hermione?Ó 
Before they could say more than Òfine,Ó the dungeon door 
opened and SlughornÕs belly preced
ed him out of the door. As they 
filed into the room, his great wa
lrus mustache curved above his 
beaming mouth, and he greeted Ha
rry and Zabini with particular 
enthusiasm. 
The dungeon was, most unusually,
 already full of vapors and 
odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermio
ne sniffed interestedly as they 
passed large, bubbling cauldrons. 
The four Slytherins took a table 
together, as did the four Ravenc
laws. This left Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a 
gold-colored cauldron that was em
itting one of the most seductive 
scents Harry had ever inhaled: So
mehow it reminded him simulta-
neously of treacle tart
, the woody smell of 
a broomstick handle, 
and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the 
Burrow. He found that he was br
eathing very slow
ly and deeply 
and that the potionÕs fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. 
A great contentment stole over him;
 he grinned across at Ron, who 
grinned back lazily. 
ÒNow then, now then, now then,Ó
 said Slughorn, whose massive 
outline was quivering through 
the many shimmering vapors. 
ÒScales out, everyone, and potion ki
ts, and donÕt forget your copies 
of Advanced Potion-Making. 
. . .Ó 
ÒSir?Ó said Harry, raising his hand. 
ÒHarry, mÕboy?Ó 
ÒI havenÕt got a book or scales
 or anything Ñ norÕs Ron Ñ we 
didnÕt realize weÕd be able 
to do the N.E.W.T., you see ÑÓ 
 !#$%&'("")*)'"
 +85" ÒAh, yes, Professor McGonagall 
did mention . . . not to worry, 
my dear boy, not to worry at all.
 You can use ingredients from the 
store cupboard today, and IÕm sure
 we can lend you some scales, 
and weÕve got a small stock of ol
d books here, theyÕll do until you 
can write to Flourish
 and Blotts. . . .Ó 
Slughorn strode over to a corner
 cupboard and, after a momentÕs 
foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of 
Ad-vanced Potion-Making
 by Libatius Borage, 
which he gave to Harry 
and Ron along with two se
ts of tarnished scales. 
ÒNow then,Ó said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class 
and inflating his already bulging ch
est so that the buttons on his 
waistcoat threatened to burst off, 
ÒIÕve prepared a few potions for 
you to have a look at, 
just out of interest, 
you know. These are the 
kind of thing you ought to be able
 to make after completing your 
N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have he
ard of Õem, even if you havenÕt 
made Õem yet. Anyone tell
 me what this one is?Ó 
He indicated the cauldron neare
st the Slytherin table. Harry 
raised himself slightly in his seat
 and saw what looked like plain 
water boiling away inside it. 
HermioneÕs well-practiced hand hit
 the air before anybody elseÕs; 
Slughorn pointed at her. 
ÒItÕs Veritaserum, a colorless, 
odorless potion that forces the 
drinker to tell the tr
uth,Ó said Hermione. 
ÒVery good, very good!Ó said Slughorn happily. ÒNow,Ó he con-
tinued, pointing at the cauldron 
nearest the Ravenclaw table, Òthis 
one here is pretty well known. 
. . . Featured in
 a few Ministry 
leaflets lately too 
. . . Who can Ñ ?Ó 
HermioneÕs hand was fastest once more. 
 &#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +86" ÒItÕs Polyjuice Potion, sir,Ó she said. 
Harry too had recognized the slow
-bubbling, mudlike substance 
in the second cauldron, but did 
not resent Hermione getting the 
credit for answering the question; 
she, after all, was the one who 
had succeeded in
 making it, back in
 their second year. 
ÒExcellent, excellent! Now, this one 
here . . . yes, my dear?Ó said 
Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as HermioneÕs hand 
punched the air again. 
ÒItÕs Amortentia!Ó 
ÒIt is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,Ó said Slughorn, who 
was looking mightily impressed, Òb
ut I assume you know what it 
does?Ó ÒItÕs the most powerful love potion in the world!Ó said Hermione. 
ÒQuite right! You recognized it
, I suppose, by its distinctive 
mother-of-pearl sheen?Ó 
ÒAnd the steam rising in characte
ristic spirals,Ó said Hermione 
enthusiastically, Òand it
Õs supposed to smell di
fferently to each of 
us, according to what 
attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown 
grass and new parchment and ÑÓ 
But she turned slightly
 pink and did not complete the sentence. 
ÒMay I ask your name, my dear?Ó
 said Slughorn, ignoring Her-
mioneÕs embarrassment. 
ÒHermione Granger, sir.Ó 
ÒGranger? Granger? Can you po
ssibly be related to Hector 
Dagworth-Granger, who founded th
e Most Extraordinary Society 
of Potioneers?Ó 
ÒNo, I donÕt think so, sir.
 IÕm Muggle-born, you see.Ó 
Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something;  
 !#$%&'("")*)'"
 +87" both of them sniggered, but Slug
horn showed no dismay; on the 
contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was 
sitting next to her. 
ÒOho! Ô
One of my best friends is Muggl
e-born, and sheÕs the best in 
our year
!Õ IÕm assuming this is the ve
ry friend of whom you spoke, 
Harry?Ó 
ÒYes, sir,Ó said Harry. 
ÒWell, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss 
Granger,Ó said Slughorn genially. 
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had 
punched him in the face. Hermione 
turned to Harry with a radiant 
expression and whispered, ÒDid you really tell him IÕm the best in 
the year? Oh, Harry!Ó 
ÒWell, whatÕs so impressive about that?Ó whispered Ron, who for 
some reason looked annoyed. ÒYou 
are the best in the year Ñ IÕdÕve 
told him so if heÕd asked me!Ó 
Hermione smiled but made a ÒshhingÓ
 gesture, so that they could 
hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled. 
ÒAmortentia doesnÕt really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible 
to manufacture or imitate love. No
, this will simply cause a power-
ful infatuation or obsession. It is
 probably the most dangerous and 
powerful potion in this room Ñ 
oh yes,Ó he said, nodding gravely 
at Malfoy and Nott, both of wh
om were smirking skeptically. 
ÒWhen you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not un-
derestimate the power of
 obsessive love. . . . 
ÒAnd now,Ó said Slughorn, Òit is
 time for us to start work.Ó ÒSir, you havenÕt told us whatÕs 
in this one,Ó said Ernie Macmil-
lan, pointing at a small black ca
uldron standing on SlughornÕs 
desk. The potion within was spla
shing about merrily; it was the 
&#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +8," color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish 
above the surface, though not a particle had spilled. 
ÒOho,Ó said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had 
not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dra-
matic effect. ÒYes. That. Well, 
that 
one, ladies and gentlemen, is a 
most curious little potion called Feli
x Felicis. I take it,Ó he turned, 
smiling, to look at Hermione, 
who had let out an audible gasp, 
Òthat you know what Felix Fe
licis does, Miss Granger?Ó 
ÒItÕs liquid luck,Ó said Hermione excitedly. ÒIt makes you lucky!Ó 
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighten Now all 
Harry could see of Malfoy was the 
back of his sleek blond head, 
because he was at last giving 
Slughorn his full and undivided 
attention. 
ÒQuite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, itÕs a 
funny little potion, Felix Felici
s,Ó said Slughorn. ÒDesperately 
tricky to make, and disastrous to
 get wrong. However, if brewed 
correctly, as this has been, you will 
find that all your endeavors tend 
to succeed . . . at least un
til the effects wear off.Ó 
ÒWhy donÕt people drink it all the time, sir?Ó said Terry Boot 
eagerly. 
ÒBecause if taken in excess, it 
causes giddiness, recklessness, and 
dangerous overconfidence,Ó said 
Slughorn. ÒToo much of a good 
thing, you know . . . highly toxi
c in large quantities. But taken 
sparingly, and very 
occasionally . . .Ó 
ÒHave you ever taken it, sir?Ó asked Michael Corner with great 
interest. 
ÒTwice in my life,Ó said Slughorn. ÒOnce when I was twenty-
four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with 
breakfast. Two perfect days.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*)'"
 +88" He gazed dreamily into the dist
ance. Whether he was playacting 
or not, thought Harry,
 the effect was good. 
ÒAnd that,Ó said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, Òis 
what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.Ó 
There was silence in which eve
ry bubble and gurgle of the sur-
rounding potions seemed
 magnified tenfold. 
ÒOne tiny bottle of Felix Felici
s,Ó said Slughorn, taking a mi-
nuscule glass bottle with a cork in
 it out of his pocket and showing 
it to them all. ÒEnough for twelve 
hoursÕ luck. From dawn till dusk, 
you will be lucky in 
everything you attempt. 
ÒNow, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned sub-
stance in organized competitions . 
. . sporting events, for instance, 
examinations, or elections. So the wi
nner is to use it on an ordinary 
day only . . . and watch how that
 ordinary day becomes extraor-
dinary! 
ÒSo,Ó said Slughorn, suddenly br
isk, Òhow are you to win my 
fabulous prize? Well, by 
turning to page ten of 
Advanced Potion-
Making. We have a little over an hour
 left to us, which should be 
time for you to make a decent at
tempt at the Draught of Living 
Death. I know it is more comp
lex than anything you have at-
tempted before, and I do not expe
ct a perfect potion from any-
body. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. 
Off you go!Ó 
There was a scraping as everyo
ne drew their cauldrons toward 
them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to 
their scales, but nobody spoke. Th
e concentration within the room 
was almost tangible. Harry saw Malf
oy riffling feverishly through 
his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 It could not have
 been clearer  
 &#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +89" that Malfoy really wanted that 
lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over 
the tattered book Sl
ughorn had lent him. 
To his annoyance he saw that th
e previous owner had scribbled 
all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed 
portions. Bending low to decipher
 the ingredients (even here, the 
previous owner had made annota
tions and crossed things out) 
Harry hurried off toward the stor
e cupboard to find what he 
needed. As he dashed back to his 
cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting 
up valerian roots as fast as he could. 
Everyone kept glancing around at
 what the rest 
of the class was 
doing; this was both an advantage 
and a disadvantage of Potions, 
that it was hard to keep your work
 private. Within ten minutes, the 
whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed 
to have progressed furthest. He
r potion already resembled the 
Òsmooth, black currant-colored liquidÓ mentioned as the ideal 
halfway stage. 
Having finished chopping his 
roots, Harry bent low over his 
book again. It was really very irri
tating, having to try and decipher 
the directions under all the stupid
 scribbles of the previous owner, 
who for some reason had taken issu
e with the order to cut up the 
sopophorous bean and had written 
in the alternative instruction: 
!"#$%&'()%&*+,)&$(-.&/*&$(+0."&-,11."2&
".+.,$.$&3#(4.&5.))."&)%,6&4#))(617&
ÒSir, I think you knew my gr
andfather, Abraxas Malfoy?Ó 
Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table. 
ÒYes,Ó said Slughorn, without look
ing at Malfoy, ÒI was sorry to  
 !#$%&'("")*)'"
 +9:" hear he had died, although of cour
se it wasnÕt unexpected, dragon 
pox at his age. . . .Ó 
And he walked away. Harry bent 
back over his cauldron, smirk-
ing. He could tell that
 Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry 
or Zabini; perhaps even hoped fo
r some preferential treatment of 
the type he had learned to expect 
from Snape. It looked as though 
Malfoy would have to re
ly on nothing but talent to win the bottle 
of Felix Felicis. 
The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. 
Harry turned to Hermione. 
ÒCan I borrow your silver knife?Ó 
She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, 
which was still deep purple, though
 according to the book ought to 
be turning a light shade of lilac by now. 
Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his as-
tonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed 
the shriveled bean could have held it
 all. Hastily scooping it all into 
the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately 
turned exactly the shade of li
lac described by the textbook. 
His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, 
Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According to 
the book, he had to stir counterc
lockwise until the potion turned 
clear as water. Accord
ing to the addition the previous owner had 
made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh 
counterclockwise stir. Could th
e old owner be right twice? 
Harry stirred counterclockwise, held
 his breath, and stirred once 
clockwise. The effect was immediat
e. The potion turned palest 
pink. ÒHow are you doing that?Ó de
manded Hermione, who was red-
&#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +9+" faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes 
from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. 
ÒAdd a clockwise stir ÑÓ 
ÒNo, no, the book says counterclockwise!Ó she snapped. 
Harry shrugged and continued what
 he was doing. Seven stirs 
counterclockwise, one clockwise, 
pause . . . seven stirs counter-
clockwise, one stir
 clockwise . . . 
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his 
potion looked like liquid licori
ce. Harry glanced around. As far as 
he could see, no one elseÕs potion 
had turned as pale as his. He felt 
elated, something that had certainl
y never happened before in this 
dungeon. ÒAnd timeÕs . . . up!Ó called Sl
ughorn. ÒStop stirring, please!Ó 
Slughorn moved slowly among th
e tables, peering into caul-
drons. He made no comment, but 
occasionally gave the potions a 
stir or a sniff. At last he reac
hed the table where Harry, Ron, Her-
mione, and Ernie were sitting. He
 smiled ruefully at the tarlike 
substance in RonÕs cauldron. He passed over ErnieÕs navy concoc-
tion. HermioneÕs potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw 
HarryÕs, and a look of incredulou
s delight spread over his face. 
ÒThe clear winner!Ó he cried to 
the dungeon. ÒExcellent, excel-
lent, Harry! Good lord, itÕs clear yo
uÕve inherited your motherÕs tal-
ent. She was a dab hand at Potions,
 Lily was! Here you are, then, 
here you are Ñ one bottle of Felix 
Felicis, as promised, and use it 
well!Ó Harry slipped the tiny bottle of
 golden liquid into his inner 
pocket, feeling an odd combination 
of delight at the furious looks 
on the SlytherinsÕ faces and guilt at
 the disappointed expression on 
HermioneÕs. Ron looked simply dumbfounded. 
!#$%&'("")*)'"
 +93" ÒHow did you do that?Ó he whispe
red to Harry as they left the 
dungeon. ÒGot lucky, I suppose,Ó said Ha
rry, because Malfoy was within 
earshot. 
Once they were securely ensconc
ed at the Gryffindor table for 
dinner, however, he felt safe enough 
to tell them. HermioneÕs face 
became stonier with ev
ery word he uttered. 
ÒI sÕpose you think I cheated?Ó 
he finished, aggravated by her 
expression. 
ÒWell, it wasnÕt exactly your own 
work, was it?Ó she said stiffly. 
ÒHe only followed different instru
ctions to ours,Ó said Ron. 
ÒCouldÕve been a catastrophe, couldnÕt
 it? But he took a risk and it 
paid off.Ó He heaved a sigh. ÒSlu
ghorn couldÕve handed me that 
book, but no, I get the one no oneÕs ever written on. 
Puked
 on, by 
the look of page fifty-two, but ÑÓ 
ÒHang on,Ó said a voice close by HarryÕs left ear and he caught a 
sudden waft of that flowery smell 
he had picked up in SlughornÕs 
dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. 
ÒDid I hear right? YouÕve been taking orders from something some-
one wrote in a book, Harry?Ó 
She looked alarmed and angry.
 Harry knew what was on her 
mind at once. 
ÒItÕs nothing,Ó he said reassuring
ly, lowering his voice. ÒItÕs not 
like, you know, RiddleÕs diary. ItÕs
 just an old textbook someoneÕs 
scribbled on.Ó 
ÒBut youÕre doing what it says?Ó 
ÒI just tried a few of the tips 
written in the margins, honestly, 
Ginny, thereÕs nothing funny ÑÓ 
ÒGinnyÕs got a point,Ó said Hermione, perking up at once. ÒWe 
&#'""#$-./0-112""%(*)!'"
 +94" ought to check that thereÕs noth
ing odd about it. I 
mean, all these 
funny instructions, who knows?Ó 
ÒHey!Ó said Harry indignantly,
 as she pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag an
d raised her wand. 
ÒSpecialis Revelio!Ó she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. 
Nothing whatsoever happened. The 
book simply lay there, look-
ing old and dirty 
and dog-eared. 
ÒFinished?Ó said Harry irritably. 
ÒOr dÕyou want to wait and see 
if it does a few backflips?Ó 
ÒIt seems all right,Ó said Hermione
, still staring at the book sus-
piciously. ÒI mean, it really does se
em to be . . . ju
st a textbook.Ó 
ÒGood. Then IÕll have it back,Ó 
said Harry, snatching it off the 
table, but it slipped from his ha
nd and landed open on the floor. 
Nobody else was lookin
g. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, 
and as he did so, he saw somet
hing scribbled along the bottom of 
the back cover in the same small,
 cramped handwriting as the in-
structions that had won him his bo
ttle of Felix Felicis, now safely 
hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.

   or the rest of the weekÕs Potions lessons Harry continued to 
follow the Half-Blood PrinceÕs instructions wherever they de-
viated from Libatius BorageÕs, with the result that by their fourth 
lesson Slughorn was ravi
ng about HarryÕs abilit
ies, saying that he 
had rarely taught anyone so tale
nted. Neither Ron nor Hermione 
was delighted by this. Although 
Harry had offered to share his 
book with both of them, Ron had 
more difficulty deciphering the 
handwriting than Harry did, and 
could not keep asking Harry to 
read aloud or it might look susp
icious. Hermione, meanwhile, was 
resolutely plowing on with what she called the ÒofficialÓ instruc-
tions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded 
poorer results than the PrinceÕs. 
Harry wondered vaguely who the 
Half-Blood Prince had been. 
Although the amount of homework
 they had been given prevented 
him from reading the whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
 sufficiently to see that there was barely 
0"&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" *+2" a page on which the Prince had no
t made additional notes, not all 
of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were direc-
tions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up 
himself. 
ÒOr herself,Ó said Hermione irri
tably, overhearing Harry point-
ing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday 
evening. ÒIt might have been a girl
. I think the handwriting looks 
more like a girlÕs than a boyÕs.Ó 
ÒThe Half-Blood 
Prince, he was called,Ó Harry said. ÒHow many 
girls have been Princes?Ó 
Hermione seemed to have no answ
er to this. She merely scowled 
and twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away 
from Ron, who was trying 
to read it upside down. 
Harry looked at his watch and hu
rriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 back into his bag. 
ÒItÕs five to eight, 
IÕd better go, IÕll be 
late for Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒOoooh!Ó gasped Hermione, looking up at once. ÒGood luck! 
WeÕll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!Ó 
ÒHope it goes okay,Ó said Ron, and the pair of them watched 
Harry leave through 
the portrait hole. 
Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to 
step hastily behind a statue wh
en Professor Trelawney appeared 
around a corner, muttering to hers
elf as she shuffled a pack of 
dirty-looking playing cards, 
reading them as she walked. 
ÒTwo of spades: conflict,Ó she murmured, as she passed the place 
where Harry crouched, hidden. ÒSeven of spades: an ill omen. Ten 
of spades: violence. Knave of sp
ades: a dark young man, possibly 
troubled, one who dislik
es the questioner ÑÓ 
She stopped dead, right on the other side of HarryÕs statue. 
!#$%&'(""&')"
 *+3" ÒWell, that canÕt be right,Ó sh
e said, annoyed, and Harry heard 
her reshuffling vigorously as she 
set off again, le
aving nothing but 
a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was 
quite sure she had gone, then hurrie
d off again until he reached the 
spot in the seventh-floor corridor
 where a single gargoyle stood 
against the wall. 
ÒAcid Pops,Ó said Harry, and the 
gargoyle leapt aside; the wall 
behind it slid apart, and a moving
 spiral stone staircase was re-
vealed, onto which Harry stepped, 
so that he was carried in smooth 
circles up to the door with the br
ass knocker that led to Dumble-
doreÕs office. 
Harry knocked. 
ÒCome in,Ó said DumbledoreÕs voice. 
ÒGood evening, sir,Ó said Harry, wa
lking into the headmasterÕs 
office. ÒAh, good evening, Harry. Sit 
down,Ó said Dumbledore, smil-
ing. ÒI hope youÕve had an enjoya
ble first week back at school?Ó 
ÒYes, thanks, sir,Ó said Harry. 
ÒYou must have been busy, a dete
ntion under your belt already!Ó 
ÒEr,Ó began Harry awkwardly, bu
t Dumbledore did not look too 
stern. ÒI have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your de-
tention next Saturday instead.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry, who had more
 pressing matters on his mind 
than SnapeÕs detention, and now 
looked around surreptitiously 
for some indication of what Du
mbledore was planni
ng to do with 
him this evening. The ci
rcular office looked just as it always did; 
the delicate silver instruments sto
od on spindle-legged tables, puff-
ing smoke and whirring; portrait
s of previous headmasters and 
&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" *+4" headmistresses dozed in their frames, and DumbledoreÕs magnifi-
cent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watch-
ing Harry with bright interest. 
It did not even look as though 
Dumbledore had cleared a sp
ace for dueling practice. 
ÒSo, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. ÒYou 
have been wondering, I am sure, 
what I have planned for you dur-
ing these Ñ for want of 
a better word Ñ lessons?Ó 
ÒYes, sir.Ó 
ÒWell, I have decided that it is
 time, now that you know what 
prompted Lord Voldemort to try an
d kill you fifteen years ago, for 
you to be given ce
rtain information.Ó 
There was a pause. 
ÒYou said, at the end of last te
rm, you were going to tell me 
everything,Ó said Harry. It was hard
 to keep a note of accusation 
from his voice. ÒSir,Ó he added. 
ÒAnd so I did,Ó said Dumbledore pl
acidly. ÒI told you everything 
I know. From this point forth, we 
shall be leaving the firm founda-
tion of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of 
memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, 
Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who be-
lieved the time was ripe 
for a cheese cauldron.Ó 
ÒBut you think youÕre 
right?Ó said Harry. 
ÒNaturally I do, but as I have al
ready proven to yo
u, I make mis-
takes like the next man. In fact, 
being Ñ forgive me Ñ rather clev-
erer than most men, my mistak
es tend to be correspondingly 
huger.Ó 
ÒSir,Ó said Harry tentatively, Òdoe
s what youÕre go
ing to tell me 
have anything to do with the pr
ophecy? Will it help me . . . 
survive?Ó !#$%&'(""&')"
 *+5" ÒIt has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,Ó said Dumble-
dore, as casually as if Harry ha
d asked him about the next dayÕs 
weather, Òand I certainl
y hope that it will 
help you to survive.Ó 
Dumbledore got to his feet and wa
lked around the desk, past 
Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bend-
ing over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straight-
ened up, he was holding a familiar 
shallow stone basin etched with 
odd markings around its rim. He plac
ed the Pensieve on the desk in 
front of Harry. 
ÒYou look worried.Ó 
Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some appre-
hension. His previous experiences 
with the odd device that stored 
and revealed thoughts and memori
es, though highly instructive, 
had also been uncomfortable. The 
last time he had disturbed its 
contents, he had seen much more 
than he would have wished. But 
Dumbledore was smiling. 
ÒThis time, you enter the Pensieve 
with me . . . and, even more 
unusually, with permission.Ó 
ÒWhere are we going, sir?Ó 
ÒFor a trip down Bob OgdenÕs memory lane,Ó said Dumbledore, 
pulling from his pocket a crysta
l bottle containing a swirling 
silvery-white substance. 
ÒWho was Bob Ogden?Ó 
ÒHe was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforce-
ment,Ó said Dumbledore
. ÒHe died some time ago, but not before 
I had tracked him down and persua
ded him to confide these recol-
lections to me. We are about to 
accompany him on a visit he made 
in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry . . .Ó 
 &#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" *++" But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of 
the crystal bottle: His injured ha
nd seemed stiff and painful. 
ÒShall Ñ shall I, sir?Ó 
ÒNo matter, Harry ÑÓ 
Dumbledore pointed his wand at 
the bottle and the cork flew 
out. ÒSir Ñ how did you injure your 
hand?Ó Harry asked again, look-
ing at the blackened fingers with 
a mixture of revulsion and pity. 
ÒNow is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have 
an appointment with Bob Ogden.Ó 
Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the 
Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. 
ÒAfter you,Ó said Dumbledore
, gesturing toward the bowl. 
Harry bent forward, took a deep
 breath, and plunged his face 
into the silvery substance. He felt 
his feet leave the office floor; he 
was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-
denly, he was blinking in dazzli
ng sunlight. Before his eyes had 
adjusted, Dumbledore la
nded beside him. 
They were standing in a count
ry lane bordered by high, tangled 
hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-
me-not. Some ten feet in front of
 them stood a short, plump man 
wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike 
specks. He was reading a wooden sign
post that was sticking out of 
the brambles on the left-hand side
 of the road. Harry knew this 
must be Ogden; he was the only pe
rson in sight, and he was also 
wearing the strange assortment of 
clothes so often chosen by inex-
perienced wizards trying 
to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock 
coat and spats over a 
striped one-piece bathing costume. Before  
 !#$%&'(""&')"
 677" Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, 
however, Ogden had se
t off at a brisk walk down the lane. 
Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden 
sign, Harry looked up at its two 
arms. The one pointing back the 
way they had come read: 
Great Hangleton, 
5 miles
. The arm 
pointing after Ogden said 
Little Hangleton, 
1 mile
. They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, 
the wide blue sky overhead and th
e swishing, frock-coated figure 
ahead. Then the lane curved to 
the left and fell away, sloping 
steeply down a hillside, so that th
ey had a sudden, unexpected view 
of a whole valley laid out in fron
t of them. Harry could see a vil-
lage, undoubtedly Littl
e Hangleton, nestle
d between two steep 
hills, its church and graveyard clea
rly visible. Across the valley, set 
on the opposite hillside, was a 
handsome manor house surrounded 
by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. 
Ogden had broken into a reluctan
t trot due to the steep down-
ward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried 
to keep up. He thought Little Ha
ngleton must be their final desti-
nation and wondered, as he had 
done on the night they had found 
Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He 
soon discovered that he was mist
aken in thinking that they were 
going to the village, however. 
The lane curved to the right and 
when they rounded the corner, it 
was to see the very edge of Og-
denÕs frock coat vanishing th
rough a gap in the hedge. 
Dumbledore and Harry followed him
 onto a narrow dirt track 
bordered by higher and wilder hedg
erows than those they had left 
behind. The path was crooked, ro
cky, and potholed, sloping down-
hill like the last one, an
d it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark 
trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up 
&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 67*" at the copse, and Dumbledore and 
Harry came to a halt behind 
Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. 
Despite the cloudless sky, the old 
trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool 
shadows, and it was a few seconds 
before HarryÕs eyes discerned the 
building half-hidden amongst the tang
le of trunks. It seemed to him 
a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision 
to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of 
the valley below. He wondered wh
ether it was inhabited; its walls 
were mossy and so many tiles had fa
llen off the roof that the rafters 
were visible in places. Nettles grew 
all around it, their tips reaching 
the windows, which were tiny and th
ick with grime. 
Just as he had 
concluded that nobody could possib
ly live there, however, one of 
the windows was thrown open with a 
clatter, and a thin trickle of 
steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. 
Ogden moved forward quietly and, 
it seemed to Harry, rather 
cautiously. As the dark shadows 
of the trees slid over him, he 
stopped again, staring at the fr
ont door, to which somebody had 
nailed a dead snake. 
Then there was a rustle and a crac
k, and a man in rags dropped 
from the nearest tree, landing on 
his feet right in front of Ogden, 
who leapt backward so fast he st
ood on the tails of his frock coat 
and stumbled. 
ÒYouÕre not welcome.
Ó The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with 
dirt it could have been any color. 
Several of his teeth were missing. 
His eyes were small and 
dark and stared in op
posite directions. He 
might have looked comical, but 
he did not; the effect was frighten-
ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several 
more paces before he spoke. 
!#$%&'(""&')"
 676" ÒEr Ñ good morning. IÕm from
 the Ministry of Magic ÑÓ 
ÒYouÕre not welcome.
Ó ÒEr Ñ IÕm sorry Ñ I donÕt unde
rstand you,Ó said Ogden 
nervously. 
Harry thought Ogden was being 
extremely dim; the stranger 
was making himself very 
clear in HarryÕs opinion, particularly as he 
was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody 
knife in the other. 
ÒYou understand him, IÕm sure, 
Harry?Ó said Dumbledore quietly. 
ÒYes, of course,Ó said Harry, sl
ightly nonplussed. ÒWhy canÕt 
Ogden Ñ ?Ó 
But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he sud-
denly understood. 
ÒHeÕs speaking Parseltongue?Ó 
ÒVery good,Ó said Dumbledo
re, nodding and smiling. 
The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one 
hand, wand in the other. 
ÒNow, look ÑÓ Ogden began, bu
t too late: There was a bang, 
and Ogden was on the ground, cl
utching his nose, while a nasty 
yellowish goo squirted fr
om between his fingers. 
ÒMorfin!Ó said a loud voice. 
An elderly man had come hurrying
 out of the cottage, banging 
the door behind him so that the 
dead snake swung pathetically. 
This man was shorter than the fi
rst, and oddly proportioned; his 
shoulders were very broad and his 
arms overlong, which, with his 
bright brown eyes, short scrubby ha
ir, and wrinkled face, gave him 
the look of a powerful, aged monk
ey. He came to a halt beside the 
man with the knife, who was now 
cackling with laughter at the 
sight of Ogden on the ground. 
&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 678" ÒMinistry, is it?Ó said the ol
der man, looking down at Ogden. 
ÒCorrect!Ó said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. ÒAnd you, I take 
it, are Mr. Gaunt?Ó 
ÒSÕright,Ó said Gaunt. ÒGot
 you in the fa
ce, did he?Ó 
ÒYes, he did!Ó 
snapped Ogden. 
ÒShouldÕve made your presence 
known, shouldnÕt you?Ó said 
Gaunt aggressively. ÒThis is privat
e property. CanÕt just walk in 
here and not expect my son to defend himself.Ó 
ÒDefend himself against what, ma
n?Ó said Ogden, clambering 
back to his feet. 
ÒBusybodies. Intruders.
 Muggles and filth.Ó 
Ogden pointed his wand at his ow
n nose, which was still issuing 
large amounts of what 
looked like yellow pus,
 and the flow stopped 
at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. 
ÒGet in the house. DonÕt argue.
Ó This time, ready for it, Harry 
recognized Parseltongue; even 
while he could understand what 
was being said, he distinguished 
the weird hissing noise that wa
s all Ogden could hear. Morfin 
seemed to be on the point of disa
greeing, but when his father cast 
him a threatening look he change
d his mind, lumbering away to 
the cottage with an odd rolling ga
it and slamming the front door 
behind him, so that the 
snake swung sadly again. 
ÒItÕs your son IÕm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,Ó said Ogden, as he 
mopped the last of the pus from 
the front of his coat. ÒThat was 
Morfin, wasnÕt it?Ó 
ÒAr, that was Morfin,Ó said th
e old man indifferently. ÒAre you 
pure-blood?Ó he asked,
 suddenly aggressive. 
ÒThatÕs neither here nor there,
Ó said Ogden coldly, and Harry 
felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather 
!#$%&'(""&')"
 67," differently. He squinted into Ogd
enÕs face and muttered, in what 
was clearly supposed to be an offen
sive tone, ÒNow I come to think 
about it, IÕve seen noses like
 yours down in the village.Ó 
ÒI donÕt doubt it, if your sonÕs be
en let loose on them,Ó said Og-
den. ÒPerhaps we could contin
ue this discussion inside?Ó 
ÒInside?Ó 
ÒYes, Mr. Gaunt. IÕve already to
ld you. IÕm here about Morfin. 
We sent an owl ÑÓ 
ÒIÕve no use for owls,Ó said Gaunt. ÒI donÕt open letters.Ó 
ÒThen you can hardly complain th
at you get no warning of vis-
itors,Ó said Ogden tartly. ÒI am he
re following a serious breach of 
Wizarding law, which occurred here
 in the early hours of this 
morning ÑÓ 
ÒAll right, all right, all right!
Ó bellowed Gaunt. ÒCome in the 
bleeding house, 
then, and much good itÕll do you!Ó 
The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led 
off the main room, which served 
as kitchen and living room com-
bined. Morfin was sitting in a filt
hy armchair beside the smoking 
fire, twisting a live adder betw
een his thick fingers and crooning 
softly at it in Parseltongue: 
 Hissy, hissy, little snakey,
 Slither on the floor,
 You be good to Morfin
 Or heÕll nail you to the door. 
 There was a scuffling noise in 
the corner beside the open win-
dow, and Harry realized that there 
was somebody else in the room, 
a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone 
&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 672" wall behind her. She was standing 
beside a steaming pot on a grimy 
black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-
looking pots and pans 
above it. Her hair was 
lank and dull and she 
had a plain, pale, rather heavy fa
ce. Her eyes, like her brotherÕs, 
stared in opposite directions. She 
looked a little cleaner than the 
two men, but Harry thought he 
had never seen a more defeated-
looking person. 
ÒMÕdaughter, Merope,Ó said Gaun
t grudgingly, as Ogden looked 
inquiringly toward her. 
ÒGood morning,Ó 
said Ogden. 
She did not answer, but with a fr
ightened glance at her father 
turned her back on th
e room and continued shifting the pots on 
the shelf behind her. 
ÒWell, Mr. Gaunt,Ó said Ogden, Òt
o get straight to the point, we 
have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in 
front of a Muggle 
late last night.Ó 
There was a deafening clang. Me
rope had dropped one of the 
pots. ÒPick it up
!Ó Gaunt bellowed at her. ÒThatÕs it, grub on the floor 
like some filthy Muggle, whatÕs your
 wand for, you useless sack of 
muck?Ó 
ÒMr. Gaunt, please!Ó said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, 
who had already picked up the pot,
 flushed blotchily scarlet, lost 
her grip on the pot again, drew 
her wand shakily from her pocket, 
pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that 
caused the pot to shoot across the 
floor away from her, hit the op-
posite wall, and crack in two. 
Morfin let out a mad cackle 
of laughter. Gaunt screamed, 
ÒMend it, you pointles
s lump, mend it!Ó 
!#$%&'(""&')"
 673" Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to 
raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, Ò
Reparo.Ó The pot mended itself instantly. 
Gaunt looked for a moment as th
ough he was going to shout at 
Ogden, but seemed to think better 
of it: Instead, he jeered at his 
daughter, ÒLucky the nice man fr
om the MinistryÕs here, isnÕt it? 
Perhaps heÕll take you off my hand
s, perhaps he doesnÕt mind dirty 
Squibs. . . .Ó 
Without looking at anybody or
 thanking Ogden, Merope 
picked up the pot and returned it, 
hands trembling, to its shelf. She 
then stood quite still, her back ag
ainst the wall betw
een the filthy 
window and the stove, as though 
she wished for nothing more than 
to sink into the stone and vanish. 
ÒMr. Gaunt,Ó Ogden began again, Òas IÕve said: the reason for 
my visit ÑÓ 
ÒI heard you the first time!Ó snapped Gaunt. ÒAnd so what? 
Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him Ñ what 
about it, then?Ó 
ÒMorfin has broken Wizarding 
law,Ó said Ogden sternly. 
ÒÔMorfin has broken Wizarding law.ÕÓ Gaunt imitated OgdenÕs 
voice, making it pompous and si
ngsong. Morfin cackled again. 
ÒHe taught a filthy Muggle a lesso
n, thatÕs illegal now, is it?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Ogden. ÒIÕm afraid it is.Ó 
He pulled from an inside pocket 
a small scroll of parchment and 
unrolled it. 
ÒWhatÕs that, then, his sentence?Ó 
said Gaunt, his voice rising 
angrily. 
ÒIt is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing ÑÓ 
 &#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 674" ÒSummons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning 
my son anywhere?Ó 
ÒIÕm Head of the Magical Law E
nforcement Squad,Ó said Ogden. 
ÒAnd you think weÕre scum, do yo
u?Ó screamed Gaunt, advanc-
ing on Ogden now, with a dirty yell
ow-nailed finger pointing at his 
chest. ÒScum whoÕll come running when the Ministry tells Õem to? 
Do you know who youÕre talking 
to, you filthy little Mudblood, do 
you? ÒI was under the impre
ssion that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,Ó 
said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. 
ÒThatÕs right!Ó roared Gaunt.
 For a moment, Harry thought 
Gaunt was making an ob
scene hand gesture, bu
t then realized that 
he was showing Ogden the ugly, bl
ack-stoned ring he was wearing 
on his middle finger, waving it before OgdenÕs eyes. ÒSee this? See 
this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries itÕs 
been in our family, thatÕs how fa
r back we go, and pure-blood all 
the way! Know how much IÕve been offered for this, with the 
Peverell coat of arms 
engraved on the stone?Ó 
ÒIÕve really no idea,Ó said Ogd
en, blinking as the ring sailed 
within an inch of his nose, Òand 
itÕs quite beside the point, Mr. 
Gaunt. Your son has committed ÑÓ 
With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran 
toward his daughter. For a split 
second, Harry thought he was going to
 throttle her as his hand flew 
to her throat; next moment, he wa
s dragging her toward Ogden by 
a gold chain around her neck. 
ÒSee this?Ó he bellowed at Ogden,
 shaking a heavy gold locket at 
him, while Merope spluttere
d and gasped for breath. 
ÒI see it, I see it!Ó said Ogden hastily. 
 !#$%&'(""&')"
 675" ÒSlytherinÕs
!Ó yelled Gaunt. ÒSalazar Slyt
herinÕs! WeÕre his last liv-
ing descendants, what do you say to that, eh?Ó 
ÒMr. Gaunt, your daughter!Ó sa
id Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt 
had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to 
her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air. 
ÒSo!Ó said Gaunt triumphantly, as
 though he had just proved a 
complicated point beyond all possib
le dispute. ÒDonÕt you go talk-
ing to us as if weÕre dirt on yo
ur shoes! Generations of purebloods, 
wizards all Ñ more than 
you can say, I 
donÕt doubt!Ó 
And he spat on the floor at Og
denÕs feet. Morfin cackled again. 
Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face 
hidden by her lank hair, said nothing. 
ÒMr. Gaunt,Ó said Ogden doggedly,
 ÒI am afraid that neither 
your ancestors nor mine have anyt
hing to do with the matter in 
hand. I am here because of Morf
in, Morfin and the Muggle he ac-
costed late last night. Our informationÓ Ñ he glanced down at his 
scroll of parchment Ñ Òis that Morf
in performed a jinx or hex on 
the said Muggle, causing him to 
erupt in highly painful hives.Ó 
Morfin giggled. 
ÒBe quiet, boy,
Ó snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell 
silent again. 
ÒAnd so what if he did, then?Ó Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden. ÒI 
expect youÕve wiped the MuggleÕs fi
lthy face clean for him, and his 
memory to boot ÑÓ 
ÒThatÕs hardly the point, is it
, Mr. Gaunt?Ó said Ogden. ÒThis 
was an unprovoked
 attack on a defenseless ÑÓ 
ÒAr, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw 
you,Ó sneered Gaunt, and he 
spat on the floor again. 
ÒThis discussion is getting us no
where,Ó said Ogden firmly. ÒIt is 
&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 67+" clear from your sonÕs attitude that
 he feels no remorse for his ac-
tions.Ó He glanced down at his sc
roll of parchment again. ÒMorfin 
will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the 
charges of using magic in front of
 a Muggle and causing harm and 
distress to that same Mugg ÑÓ 
Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and 
loud, laughing voices were drif
ting in through the open window. 
Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the 
copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. 
Morfin hissed and turned his face
 toward the sounds, his expres-
sion hungry. Merope raised her 
head. Her face, Harry saw, was 
starkly white. 
ÒMy God, what an eyesore!Ó rang out a girlÕs voice, as clearly au-
dible through the open window as 
if she had stood in the room be-
side them. ÒCouldnÕt your father have that hovel cleared away, 
Tom?Ó ÒItÕs not ours,Ó said a young manÕs voice. ÒEverything on the 
other side of the valley belongs to 
us, but that cottage belongs to an 
old tramp called Gaunt, and his ch
ildren. The sonÕs quite mad, you 
should hear some of the storie
s they tell in 
the village ÑÓ 
The girl laughed. The jingling, 
clopping noises were growing 
louder and louder. Morfin made
 to get out of his armchair. 
ÒKeep your seat,
Ó said his father warnin
gly, in Parseltongue. 
ÒTom,Ó said the girlÕs voice again, now so close they were clearly 
right beside the house, ÒI migh
t be wrong Ñ but has somebody 
nailed a snake to that door?Ó 
ÒGood lord, youÕre right!Ó said the manÕs voice. ÒThatÕll be the 
son, I told you heÕs not right in th
e head. DonÕt look at it, Cecilia, 
darling.Ó !#$%&'(""&')"
 6*7" The jingling and clopping soun
ds were now growing fainter 
again. ÒÔDarling,ÕÓ whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his 
sister. ÒÔ
Darling,Õ he called her. So he wo
uldnÕt have you anyway.
Ó Merope was so white Harry felt 
sure she was going to faint. 
ÒWhatÕs that
?Ó said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking 
from his son to his daughter. Ò
What did you say, Morfin
?Ó ÒShe likes looking at that Muggle,
Ó said Morfin, a vicious expres-
sion on his face as he stared at 
his sister, who now looked terrified. 
ÒAlways in the garden when he pa
sses, peering through the hedge at 
him, isnÕt she? And last night
 ÑÓ 
Merope shook her head jerkily, im
ploringly, but Morfin went on 
ruthlessly, Ò
Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, 
wasnÕt she
?Ó ÒHanging out of the window to look at a Muggle
?Ó said Gaunt 
quietly. 
All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who 
was looking both bewildered and i
rritated at this renewed outbreak 
of incomprehensible 
hissing and rasping. 
ÒIs it true
?Ó said Gaunt in a deadly vo
ice, advancing a step or two 
toward the terrified girl. Ò
My daughter 
Ñ pure-blooded descendant 
of Salazar Slytherin 
Ñ hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle
?Ó Merope shook her head frantically, 
pressing herself into the wall, 
apparently unable to speak. 
ÒBut I got him, Father
!Ó cackled Morfin. Ò
I got him as he went by 
and he didnÕt look so pretty with
 hives all over hi
m, did he, Merope
?Ó ÒYou disgusting little Squib, yo
u filthy little blood traitor
!Ó roared 
Gaunt, losing control, and his ha
nds closed around his daughterÕs 
throat. &#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 6**" Both Harry and Ogden yelled ÒN
o!Ó at the same time; Ogden 
raised his wand and cried, Ò
Relashio!Ó Gaunt was thrown backward, 
away from his daughter; he tripped 
over a chair and fell flat on his 
back. With a roar of rage, Morfin 
leapt out of his chair and ran at 
Ogden, brandishing his bloody kni
fe and firing hexes indiscrimi-
nately from his wand. 
Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore 
indicated that they ought to 
follow and Harry obeyed, MeropeÕs
 screams echoin
g in his ears. 
Ogden hurtled up the path and er
upted onto the main lane, his 
arms over his head, where he coll
ided with the glossy chestnut 
horse ridden by a very handsome, da
rk-haired young man. Both he 
and the pretty girl riding beside 
him on a gray horse roared with 
laughter at the sight 
of Ogden, who bounced off the horseÕs flank 
and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in 
dust, running pell-m
ell up the lane. ÒI think that will do, Harry,Ó 
said Dumbledore. He took Harry 
by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring 
weightlessly through darkness, until 
they landed squarely on their 
feet, back in Dumbledore
Õs now twilit office. 
ÒWhat happened to the girl in th
e cottage?Ó said Harry at once, 
as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with 
a flick of his wand. ÒMerope, or 
whatever her name was?Ó 
ÒOh, she survived,Ó said Dumble
dore, reseating himself behind 
his desk and indicating that Ha
rry should sit down too. ÒOgden 
Apparated back to the Ministry an
d returned with reinforcements 
within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, 
but both were overpowered, remo
ved from the cottage, and subse-
quently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a 
record of Muggle attacks, was sent
enced to three years in Azkaban. 
!#$%&'(""&')"
 6*6" Marvolo, who had injure
d several Ministry em
ployees in addition 
to Ogden, received six months.Ó 
ÒMarvolo?Ó Harry repe
ated wonderingly. 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Dumbledore, sm
iling in approval. ÒI am glad 
to see youÕre keeping up.Ó 
ÒThat old man was Ñ ?Ó 
ÒVoldemortÕs grandfather, yes,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒMarvolo, his 
son, Morfin, and his daughter, 
Merope, were th
e last of the 
Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding fa
mily noted for a vein of insta-
bility and violence that flourished
 through the generations due to 
their habit of marrying 
their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled 
with a great liking for grandeur 
meant that the family gold was 
squandered several ge
nerations before Marv
olo was born. He, as 
you saw, was left in squalor and 
poverty, with a 
very nasty temper, 
a fantastic amount of arrogance an
d pride, and a couple of family 
heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more 
than his daughter.Ó 
ÒSo Merope,Ó said Harry, leaning 
forward in his chair and star-
ing at Dumbledore, Òso Merope wa
s . . . Sir, does that mean she 
was . . . 
VoldemortÕs mother
?Ó ÒIt does,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒAnd it
 so happens that we also had 
a glimpse of VoldemortÕs father. 
I wonder whether you noticed?Ó 
ÒThe Muggle Morfin attacked
? The man on the horse?Ó 
ÒVery good indeed,Ó said Dumble
dore, beaming. ÒYes, that was 
Tom Riddle senior, the handsome 
Muggle who used to go riding 
past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a 
secret, burning passion.Ó 
ÒAnd they ended up ma
rried?Ó Harry said in di
sbelief, unable to 
imagine two people less likely to fall in love. 
&#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 6*8" ÒI think you are forgetting,Ó 
said Dumbledore, Òthat Merope 
was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to 
their best advantage when she was 
being terrorized by her father. 
Once Marvolo and Morfin were sa
fely in Azkaban, once she was 
alone and free for the first time in 
her life, then, I am sure, she was 
able to give full rein to her abilit
ies and to plot her escape from the 
desperate life she had le
d for eighteen years. 
ÒCan you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to 
make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle 
companion, and fall in love 
with her instead?Ó 
ÒThe Imperius Curse?Ó Harry su
ggested. ÒOr a lo
ve potion?Ó 
ÒVery good. Personally, I am incl
ined to think th
at she used a 
love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, 
and I do not think it would have b
een very difficult, some hot day, 
when Riddle was riding alone, to pe
rsuade him to take a drink of 
water. In any case, within a few mo
nths of the scene we have just 
witnessed, the village of Little
 Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous 
scandal. You can imagine the gossip 
it caused when the squireÕs son 
ran off with the tram
pÕs daughter, Merope. 
ÒBut the villagersÕ shock was nothing to MarvoloÕs. He returned 
from Azkaban, expecting to find hi
s daughter dutifully awaiting his 
return with a hot meal ready on hi
s table. Instead, he found a clear 
inch of dust and her note of fare
well, explaining wh
at she had done. 
ÒFrom all that I have been able 
to discover, he never mentioned 
her name or existence from that 
time forth. The shock of her de-
sertion may have contributed to his early death Ñ or perhaps he 
had simply never learned to feed
 himself. Azkaban had greatly 
weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the 
cottage.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&')"
 6*," ÒAnd Merope? She . . . she died, 
didnÕt she? WasnÕt Voldemort 
brought up in an orphanage?Ó 
ÒYes, indeed,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWe must do a certain amount 
of guessing here, although I do no
t think it is difficult to deduce 
what happened. You see, within 
a few months of their runaway 
marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared 
at the manor house in Little 
Hangleton without his wife. The 
rumor flew around the neighbor-
hood that he was talking of bein
g ÔhoodwinkedÕ and Ôtaken in.Õ 
What he meant, I am sure, is th
at he had been under an enchant-
ment that had now lifted, though
 I daresay he did not dare use 
those precise words for fear of 
being thought insane. When they 
heard what he was saying, howeve
r, the villagers guessed that 
Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, 
pretending that she was going to 
have his baby, and that he had 
married her for this reason.Ó 
ÒBut she 
did
 have his baby.Ó 
ÒBut not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left 
her while she was still pregnant.Ó 
ÒWhat went wrong?Ó asked Harry.
 ÒWhy did the love potion 
stop working?Ó 
ÒAgain, this is guesswork,Ó said Dumbledore, Òbut I believe that 
Merope, who was deeply in love wi
th her husband, could not bear 
to continue enslaving him by ma
gical means. I believe that she 
made the choice to st
op giving him the poti
on. Perhaps, besotted 
as she was, she had convinced hers
elf that he would by now have 
fallen in love with her in return. 
Perhaps she thought he would stay 
for the babyÕs sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, 
never saw her again, and never troubl
ed to discover what became of 
his son.Ó 
 &#'""#-./'""-0""1$.)&" 6*2" The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in DumbledoreÕs 
office seemed to glow more brightly than before. 
ÒI think that will do 
for tonight, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore after 
a moment or two. 
ÒYes, sir,Ó said Harry. 
He got to his feet, but did not leave. 
ÒSir . . . is it important to know
 all this about VoldemortÕs past?Ó 
ÒVery important, I think,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒAnd it . . . itÕs got someth
ing to do with the prophecy?Ó 
ÒIt has everything to do
 with the prophecy.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same. 
He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he 
turned back again. ÒSir, am I al
lowed to tell Ron and Hermione 
everything youÕve told me?Ó 
Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, ÒYes, I 
think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trust-
worthy. But Harry, I am going to as
k you to ask them not to repeat 
any of this to anybody else. It wo
uld not be a good id
ea if word got 
around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord VoldemortÕs 
secrets.Ó 
ÒNo, sir, IÕll make sure itÕs
 just Ron and Hermione. Good 
night.Ó He turned away again, and was 
almost at the door when he saw 
it. Sitting on one of the little sp
indle-legged tables
 that supported 
so many frail-looking silver instru
ments, was an ugly gold ring set 
with a large, cracked, black stone. 
ÒSir,Ó said Harry, staring at it. ÒThat ring ÑÓ 
ÒYes?Ó said Dumbledore. 
 !#$%&'(""&')"
 6*3" ÒYou were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that 
night.Ó ÒSo I was,Ó Dumbledore agreed. 
ÒBut isnÕt it . . . sir, isnÕt it 
the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed 
Ogden?Ó Dumbledore bowed his head. ÒThe very same.Ó 
ÒBut how come Ñ ? Have you always had it?Ó 
ÒNo, I acquired it very recently,Ó
 said Dumbledore. ÒA few days 
before I came to fetch you from yo
ur aunt and uncleÕs, in fact.Ó 
ÒThat would be around the time
 you injured your hand, then, 
sir?Ó ÒAround that time, yes, Harry.Ó 
Harry hesitated. Dumb
ledore was smiling. 
ÒSir, how exactly Ñ ?Ó 
ÒToo late, Harry! You shall hear 
the story another time. Good 
night.Ó ÒGood night, sir.Ó

 s Hermione had predicted, the sixth yearsÕ free periods 
were not the hours of blissful
 relaxation Ron had antici-
pated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast 
amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they 
studying as though they had exam
s every day, but the lessons them-
selves had become more demandin
g than ever before. Harry barely 
understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these 
days; even Hermione had had to ask 
her to repeat instructions once 
or twice. Incredibly, and to He
rmioneÕs increasing resentment, 
HarryÕs best subject had suddenly be
come Potions, thanks to the 
Half-Blood Prince. 
Nonverbal spells were now ex
pected, not only in Defense 
Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. 
Harry frequently looked over at
 his classmates in the common 
room or at mealtimes to
 see them purple in 
the face and straining 
as though they had overdosed on 
U-No-Poo; but he knew that they 
$"!#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,-6" were really struggling to make spells work without saying incanta-
tions aloud. It was a relief to get 
outside into the greenhouses; they 
were dealing with more dangerous 
plants than ever in Herbology, 
but at least they were still allowe
d to swear loudly if the Venomous 
Tentacula seized them un
expectedly from behind. 
One result of their enormous wor
kload and the frantic hours of 
practicing nonverbal spells was 
that Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
had so far been unable to find time
 to go and visit Hagrid. He had 
stopped coming to meals at the sta
ff table, an ominous sign, and on 
the few occasions when they had pa
ssed him in the corridors or out 
in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear 
their greetings. 
ÒWeÕve got to go and explain,Ó said Hermione, looking up at 
HagridÕs huge empty chair at the 
staff table the following Saturday 
at breakfast. 
ÒWeÕve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!Ó said Ron. Ò
And 
weÕre supposed to be practici
ng that Aguamenti Charm from 
Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? Ho
w are we going to tell him we 
hated his stupid subject?Ó 
ÒWe didnÕt hate it
!Ó said Hermione. 
ÒSpeak for yourself, I havenÕt fo
rgotten the skrewts,Ó said Ron 
darkly. ÒAnd IÕm telling you now,
 weÕve had a narrow escape. You 
didnÕt hear him going on about 
his gormless brother Ñ weÕd have 
been teaching Grawp how to tie his
 shoelaces if weÕd stayed.Ó 
ÒI hate not talking to Hagrid,Ó said Hermione, looking upset. 
ÒWeÕll go down after Quidditch,
Ó Harry assured her. He too was 
missing Hagrid, although like Ron 
he thought that they were bet-
ter off without Grawp in their lives. ÒBut trials might take all 
morning, the number of people wh
o have applied.Ó He felt slightly 
#'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,-7" nervous at confronting the first hu
rdle of his Captaincy. ÒI dunno 
why the teamÕs this popular all of a sudden.Ó 
ÒOh, come on, Harry,Ó said Herm
ione, suddenly impatient. ÒItÕs 
not Quidditch
 thatÕs popular, itÕs you! 
YouÕve never been more in-
teresting, and frankly, youÕve
 never been mo
re fanciable.Ó 
Ron gagged on a large piece of 
kipper. Hermione spared him one 
look of disdain before 
turning back to Harry. 
ÒEveryone knows youÕve 
been telling the truth now, donÕt they? 
The whole Wizarding world has had 
to admit that you were right 
about Voldemort being back and th
at you really have fought him 
twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now theyÕre 
calling you Ôthe Chosen OneÕ Ñ 
well, come on, canÕt you see why 
people are fascinated by you?Ó 
Harry was finding the Great Hall 
very hot all of a sudden, even 
though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy. 
ÒAnd youÕve been through all that 
persecution from the Ministry 
when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. 
You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil 
woman made you write with your
 own blood, bu
t you stuck to 
your story anyway. . . .Ó 
ÒYou can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Min-
istry, look,Ó said Ron, 
shaking back his sleeves. 
ÒAnd it doesnÕt hurt that youÕ
ve grown about a foot over the 
summer either,Ó Hermione finished, ignoring Ron. 
ÒIÕm tall,Ó said Ron inconsequentially. 
The post owls arrived, swoop
ing down through rain-flecked 
windows, scattering everyone with 
droplets of water. Most people 
were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to 
hear from their children and to re
assure them, in turn, that all was

 ,,8" well at home. Harry ha
d received no mail since the start of term; 
his only regular correspondent wa
s now dead and although he had 
hoped that Lupin might write occa
sionally, he had so far been dis-
appointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white 
Hedwig circling amongst all the 
brown and gray owls. She landed 
in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, 
an identical package landed in fron
t of Ron, crushing beneath it his 
minuscule and exhauste
d owl, Pigwidgeon. 
ÒHa!Ó said Harry, unwrapping the pa
rcel to reveal a new copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 fresh from Flourish and Blotts. 
ÒOh good,Ó said Hermione, deligh
ted. ÒNow you can give that 
graffitied copy back.Ó 
ÒAre you mad?Ó said Harry. ÒIÕm
 keeping it! Look, IÕve thought 
it out ÑÓ 
He pulled the old copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his 
bag and tapped the cover wi
th his wand, muttering, Ò
Diffindo!Ó The cover fell off. He did the same
 thing with the brand-new book 
(Hermione looked scandalized). 
He then swapped the covers, 
tapped each, and said, Ò
Reparo
!Ó There sat the PrinceÕs copy, disg
uised as a new book, and there 
sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly 
secondhand. 
ÒIÕll give Slughorn back the new 
one, he canÕt complain, it cost 
nine Galleons.Ó 
Hermione pressed her lips toge
ther, looking angry and disap-
proving, but was distracted by a 
third owl landing in front of her 
carrying that dayÕs copy of the 
Daily Prophet.
 She unfolded it 
hastily and scanne
d the front page.

 ,,-" ÒAnyone we know dead?Ó asked 
Ron in a determinedly casual 
voice; he posed the same questi
on every time Hermione opened 
her paper. 
ÒNo, but there have been more dementor attacks,Ó said Hermi-
one. ÒAnd an arrest.Ó 
ÒExcellent, who?Ó said Harry, th
inking of Bellatrix Lestrange. 
ÒStan Shunpike,Ó said Hermione. 
ÒWhat?Ó said Harry, startled. 
ÒÔStanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding con-
veyance the Knight Bus, has been ar
rested on suspicion of Death Eater 
activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken 
into custody late last night after 
a raid on his Clapham home 
. . .ÕÓ 
ÒStan Shunpike, a Death Eater?
Ó said Harry, remembering the 
spotty youth he had first met three years before. ÒNo way!Ó 
ÒHe might have been put under the Imperius Curse,Ó said Ron 
reasonably. ÒYou never can tell.Ó 
ÒIt doesnÕt look like it,Ó said He
rmione, who was still reading. ÒIt 
says here he was arrested after 
he was overheard talking about the 
Death EatersÕ secret plans in a pub.
Ó She looked up with a troubled 
expression on her face. ÒIf he was under the Imperius Curse, heÕd 
hardly stand around gossiping 
about their plan

ÒIt sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he 
did,Ó said Ron. ÒIsnÕt he the o

trying to chat up those veela?Ó 
ÒYeah, thatÕs him,Ó said Harry. ÒI

 ,,," the Patil twinsÕ parents want them
 to go home? An
d Eloise Midgen 
has already been withdr
awn. Her father picked
 her up last night.Ó 
ÒWhat!Ó said Ron, goggling at
 Hermione. ÒBut Hogwarts is 
safer than their homes, bound to
 be! WeÕve got Aurors, and all 
those extra protective spells
, and weÕve got 
Dumbledore!Ó 
ÒI donÕt think weÕve got him all the time,Ó said Hermione very 
quietly, glancing toward the st
aff table over the top of the 
Prophet. ÒHavenÕt you noticed? His seatÕs been empty as often as HagridÕs 
this past week.Ó 
Harry and Ron looked up at the 
staff table. The headmasterÕs 
chair was indeed empty. Now Harry 
came to think of it, he had not 
seen Dumbledore since their 
private lesson a week ago. 
ÒI think heÕs left the school to do something with the Order,Ó 
said Hermione in a low voice. ÒI mean . . . itÕs all looking serious, 
isnÕt it? 
Harry and Ron did not answer, bu
t Harry knew that they were 
all thinking the same thing. Ther
e had been a horrible incident the 
day before, when Hannah Abbott 
had been taken out of Herbol-
ogy to be told her mother had b
een found dead. They had not seen 
Hannah since. 
When they left the Gryffindor ta
ble five minutes later to head 
down to the Quidditch pitch, th
ey passed Lavender Brown and 
Parvati Patil. Remembering what
 Hermione had said about the 
Patil twinsÕ parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was 
unsurprised to see that the two be
st friends were whispering to-
gether, looking distressed. What 
did surprise him was that when 
Ron drew level with them, Parvat
i suddenly nudged Lavender, who 
looked around and gave Ron a wide
 smile. Ron blinked at her, then 
returned the smile uncertainly. 
His walk instantly became some-
#'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,,9" thing more like a strut. Harry resist
ed the temptation to laugh, re-
membering that Ron had refrained 
from doing so after Malfoy had 
broken HarryÕs nose; Hermione, ho
wever, looked cold and distant 
all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, 
and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron 
good luck. 
As Harry had expected, the trials
 took most of the morning. 
Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first 
years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old 
school brooms, to seventh years wh
o towered over the rest, looking 
coolly intimidating. Th
e latter included a large, wiry-haired boy 
Harry recognized immediately 
from the Hogwarts Express. 
ÒWe met on the train, in old SluggyÕs compartment,Ó he said 
confidently, stepping out of th
e crowd to shake HarryÕs hand. 
ÒCormac McLaggen, Keeper.Ó 
ÒYou didnÕt try out last year, di
d you?Ó asked Harry, taking note 
of the breadth of McLaggen and t
hinking that he would probably 
block all three goal hoop
s without even moving. 
ÒI was in the hospital wing when
 they held the trials,Ó said 
McLaggen, with something of a swagger. ÒAte a pound of doxy eggs 
for a bet.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry. 
ÒWell . . . if you wait
 over there . . .Ó 
He pointed over to the edge of 
the pitch, close to where Hermi-
one was sitting. He thought he saw 
a flicker of annoyance pass over 
McLaggenÕs face and wondered 
whether McLaggen expected pref-
erential treatment because they were
 both Òold SluggyÕsÓ favorites. 
Harry decided to start with a basic 
test, asking all applicants for 
the team to divide into groups of 
ten and fly once around the pitch. 
This was a good decision: The first 
ten was made up of first years 
!#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,,:" and it could not have been plainer 
that they had hardly ever flown 
before. Only one boy managed to 
remain airborne for more than a 
few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one 
of the goal posts. 
The second group was comprised of
 ten of the silliest girls Harry 
had ever encountered, who, when he
 blew his whistle, merely fell 
about giggling and clutching o
ne another. Romilda Vane was 
amongst them. When he told them to
 leave the pitch, they did so 
quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone 
else. The third group had a pileup half
way around the pitch. Most of 
the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group 
were Hufflepuffs. 
ÒIf thereÕs anyone else here whoÕ
s not from Gryffindor,Ó roared 
Harry, who was starting to get se
riously annoyed, Òleave now, 
please!Ó There was a pause, then a couple
 of little Ravenclaws went 
sprinting off the pitch, 
snorting with laughter. 
After two hours, many complaints
, and several tantrums, one in-
volving a crashed Comet Two Sixty 
and several broken teeth, Harry 
had found himself three Chasers: Ka
tie Bell, returned to the team 
after an excellent trial; a new fi
nd called Demelza Robins, who was 
particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who 
had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to 
boot. Pleased though he was with
 his choices, Harry had also 
shouted himself hoarse at the ma
ny complainers and was now en-
during a similar 
battle with the rejected Beaters. 
ÒThatÕs my final decision and if you donÕt get out of the way for 
the Keepers IÕll hex you,Ó he bellowed. 
#'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,,;" Neither of his chosen Beaters had 
the old brilliance of Fred and 
George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy 
Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed 
to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of HarryÕs head with 
a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ri
tchie Coote, who looked weedy 
but aimed well. They now joined 
Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in 
the stands to watch the selectio
n of their last
 team member. 
Harry had deliberately left the tr
ial of the Keepers until last, 
hoping for an emptier stadium an
d less pressure on all concerned. 
Unfortunately, however, all the re
jected players and a number of 
people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had 
joined the crowd by now, so that 
it was larger than ever. As each 
Keeper flew up to the goal hoops,
 the crowd roared and jeered in 
equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a 
problem with nerves; Harry had ho
ped that winning their final 
match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was 
a delicate shade of green. 
None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals 
apiece. To HarryÕs great disappoin
tment, Cormac McLaggen saved 
four penalties out of five. On the la
st one, however, he shot off in 
completely the wrong direction; 
the crowd laughed and booed and 
McLaggen returned to the gr
ound grinding his teeth. 
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep 
Eleven. ÒGood luck!Ó cried a voice 
from the stands. Harry looked 
around, expecting to see Hermione
, but it was Lavender Brown. 
He would have quite liked to have 
hidden his face in his hands, as 
she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought 
to show slightly more 
grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial. 
Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, 
!#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,,<" five penalties in a row. Delighte
d, and resisting 
joining in the 
cheers of the crowd with difficul
ty, Harry turned 
to McLaggen to 
tell him that, most unfortunatel
y, Ron had beaten him, only to 
find McLaggenÕs red face inches from his own. He stepped back 
hastily. 
ÒHis sister didnÕt really try,
Ó said McLaggen menacingly. There 
was a vein pulsing in 
his temple like the 
one Harry had often ad-
mired in Uncle VernonÕs. ÒShe gave him an easy save.Ó 
ÒRubbish,Ó said Harry coldly. ÒThat was the one he nearly 
missed.Ó 
McLaggen took a step nearer Har
ry, who stood his ground this 
time. 
ÒGive me another go.Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry. ÒYouÕve had your go. You saved four. Ron 
saved five. RonÕs Keeper, he won it
 fair and square. Get out of my 
way.Ó He thought for a moment that
 McLaggen might punch him, 
but he contented himself with an
 ugly grimace and stormed away, 
growling what sounded like
 threats to thin air. 
Harry turned around to find 
his new team beaming at him. 
ÒWell done,Ó he croaked. ÒYou flew really well ÑÓ 
ÒYou did brilliantly, Ron!Ó 
This time it really was Hermio
ne running toward them from 
the stands; Harry saw Lavender walk
ing off the pitch, arm in arm 
with Parvati, a rather grumpy ex
pression on her face. Ron looked 
extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he 
grinned at the team
 and at Hermione. 
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following 
Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of 
#'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,,." the team and headed o
ff toward HagridÕs. A watery sun was trying 
to break through the clouds now 
and it had stoppe
d drizzling at 
last. Harry felt extremely hungry; 
he hoped there would be some-
thing to eat at HagridÕs. 
ÒI thought I was going to miss th
at fourth penalty,Ó Ron was say-
ing happily. ÒTricky shot from De
melza, did you see, had a bit of 
spin on it ÑÓ 
ÒYes, yes, you were magnificent,Ó said Hermione, looking amused. 
ÒI was better than that McLaggen 
anyway,Ó said Ron in a highly 
satisfied voice. ÒDid you see him lumbering off in the wrong direc-
tion on his fifth? Looked like heÕd been Confunded. . . .Ó 
To HarryÕs surprise, Hermione tur
ned a very deep shade of pink 
at these words. Ron noticed nothin
g; he was too busy describing 
each of his other penalties in loving detail. 
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbe
ak, was tethered in front of 
HagridÕs cabin. He clicked his ra
zor-sharp beak at their approach 
and turned his huge head toward them. 
ÒOh dear,Ó said Hermione nervously
. ÒHeÕs still a bit scary, isnÕt 
he?Ó 
ÒCome off it, youÕve ridden him
, havenÕt you?Ó said Ron. 
Harry stepped forward and bowed 
low to the hippo
griff without 
breaking eye contact or blinking
. After a few seconds, Buckbeak 
sank into a bow too. 
ÒHow are you?Ó Harry asked him 
in a low voice, moving for-
ward to stroke the feathery head. ÒMissing him? But youÕre okay 
here with Hagrid, arenÕt you?Ó 
ÒOi!Ó said a loud voice. 
Hagrid had come stri
ding around the corner of his cabin 
wearing a large flowery apron and 
carrying a sack of potatoes. His 
!#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,,6" enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming 
bark and boun
ded forward. 
ÒGit away from him! HeÕll have 
yer fingers Ñ oh. ItÕs yeh lot.Ó 
Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick 
their ears. Hagrid stood and looked 
at them all for a split second, 
then turned and strode into his 
cabin, slamming the door behind 
him. ÒOh dear!Ó said Hermio
ne, looking stricken. 
ÒDonÕt worry about it,Ó said Harry grimly. He walked over to the 
door and knocked loudly. 
ÒHagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!Ó 
There was no sound from within. 
ÒIf you donÕt open the door, weÕ
ll blast it open!Ó Harry said, 
pulling out his wand. 
ÒHarry!Ó said Hermione, sounding shocked. ÒYou canÕt pos-
sibly ÑÓ 
ÒYeah, I can!Ó said Ha
rry. ÒStand back ÑÓ 
But before he could say anything 
else, the door flew open again 
as Harry had known it would, an
d there stood Hagrid, glowering 
down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively 
alarming. ÒIÕm a teacher!Ó he roared at Ha
rry. ÒA teacher, Potter! How dare 
yeh threaten ter br
eak down my door!Ó 
ÒIÕm sorry, 
sir,Ó said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he 
stowed his wand inside his robes. 
Hagrid looked stunned. ÒSince when have yeh called me ÔsirÕ?Ó 
ÒSince when have you called me ÔPotterÕ?Ó 
ÒOh, very clever,Ó growled Hagr
id. ÒVery amusinÕ. ThatÕs me 
outsmarted, innit? All righÕ, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .Ó 
#'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,,7" Mumbling darkly, he
 stood back to let 
them pass. Hermione 
scurried in after Harry, 
looking rather frightened. 
ÒWell?Ó said Hagrid 
grumpily, as Harry, Ro
n, and Hermione sat 
down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head im-
mediately upon HarryÕs knee and 
drooling all over his robes. 
ÒWhatÕs this? FeelinÕ sorry for me? 
Reckon IÕm lonely or summat?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry at once. 
ÒWe wanted to see you.Ó 
ÒWeÕve missed you!Ó said Hermione tremulously. 
ÒMissed me, have yeh?Ó snorted Hagrid. ÒYeah. RighÕ.Ó 
He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper 
kettle, muttering all the while.
 Finally he slammed down three 
bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-bro
wn tea in front of them and a 
plate of his rock cakes. Harry wa
s hungry enough even for HagridÕs 
cooking, and took one at once. 
ÒHagrid,Ó said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the 
table and started peeling his pota
toes with a brutality that sug-
gested that each tuber had done hi
m a great personal wrong, Òwe re-
ally wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.Ó 
Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bo-
geys landed on the potatoes, and 
was inwardly thankful that they 
were not staying for dinner. 
ÒWe did!Ó said Hermione. ÒBut no
ne of us could fit it into our 
schedules!Ó 
ÒYeah. RighÕ,Ó said Hagrid again. 
There was a funny squelching soun
d and they all looked around: 
Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and 
hurried around the table away from 
the large barrel standing in the 
corner that they had only just noti
ced. It was full of what looked 
like foot-long maggots, sl
imy, white, and writhing. 
!#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,98" ÒWhat are they, Hagrid?Ó asked 
Harry, trying to sound inter-
ested rather than revolted, but pu
tting down his rock cake all the 
same. ÒJusÕ giant grubs,Ó said Hagrid. 
ÒAnd they grow into . . . ?Ó 
said Ron, looking apprehensive. 
ÒThey wonÕ grow inter nuthinÕ,Ó 
said Hagrid. ÒI got Õem ter feed 
ter Aragog.Ó 
And without warning, he
 burst into tears. 
ÒHagrid!Ó cried Herm
ione, leaping up, hu
rrying around the 
table the long way to avoid the 
barrel of maggots, and putting an 
arm around his shaking sh
oulders. ÒWhat is it?Ó 
ÒItÕs . . . him . . .Ó 
gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-
ing as he mopped his face with his apron. ÒItÕs . . . Aragog. . . . I 
think heÕs dyinÕ. . . . He got ill over the summer anÕ heÕs not gettinÕ 
better. . . . I donÕ know 
what IÕll do if he . . 
. if he . . . WeÕve bin 
tergether so long. . . .Ó 
Hermione patted HagridÕs should
er, looking at a complete loss 
for anything to say. Harry knew 
how she felt. He had known Ha-
grid to present a vicious baby dr
agon with a teddy bear, seen him 
croon over giant scorpions with 
suckers and stingers, attempt to 
reason with his brutal giant of a 
half-brother, but this was perhaps 
the most incomprehensible of all 
his monster fancies: the gigantic 
talking spider, Aragog, who dwelle
d deep in the Forbidden Forest 
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years 
previously. 
ÒIs there Ñ is there anything 
we can do?Ó Hermione asked, ig-
noring RonÕs frantic grimaces and head-shakings. 
ÒI donÕ think there is, Hermione,Ó choked Hagrid, attempting  
 #'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,9-" to stem the flood of his tears. ÒSee, 
the rest oÕ the tribe . . . AragogÕs 
family . . . theyÕre gettinÕ a bit funny 
now heÕs ill . . . bit restive . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, I think we saw a bit of that
 side of them,Ó 
said Ron in an 
undertone. 
Ò. . . I donÕ reckon itÕd be safe 
fer anyone but me ter go near the 
colony at the moÕ,Ó Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his 
apron and looking up. ÒBut thanks 
fer offerinÕ, Hermione. . . . It 
means a lot. . . .Ó 
After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although 
neither Harry nor Ron had shown 
any inclination to go and feed 
giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to 
take it for granted that they woul
d have liked to have done and be-
came his usual se
lf once more. 
ÒAr, I always knew yehÕd find it
 hard ter squeeze me inter yer 
timetables,Ó he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. ÒEven if yeh 
applied fer Time-Turners ÑÓ 
ÒWe couldnÕt have done,Ó said Hermione. ÒWe smashed the en-
tire stock of Ministry Time-Turne
rs when we were there last sum-
mer. It was in the 
Daily Prophet.
Ó ÒAr, well then,Ó said Hagrid. ÒT
hereÕs no way yeh couldÕve done 
it. . . . IÕm sorry IÕve bin Ñ yeh kn
ow Ñ IÕve jusÕ bin worried abouÕ 
Aragog . . . anÕ I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank 
had bin teachinÕ yeh ÑÓ 
At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully 
that Professor Grubbly-Plank, wh
o had substituted for Hagrid a 
few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time 
Hagrid waved them off the premis
es at dusk, he looked quite 
cheerful. 
 !#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,9," ÒIÕm starving,Ó said Harry, on
ce the door had closed behind 
them and they were hurrying th
rough the dark and deserted 
grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous crack-
ing noise from one of his back teet
h. ÒAnd IÕve got that detention 
with Snape tonight, I havenÕt got much time for dinner. . . .Ó 
As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen en-
tering the Great Hall. It took hi
m two attempts to get through the 
doors; he ricocheted off the frame 
on the first atte
mpt. Ron merely 
guffawed gloatingly and strode of
f into the Hall after him, but 
Harry caught HermioneÕs 
arm and held her back. 
ÒWhat?Ó said Hermio
ne defensively. 
ÒIf you ask me,Ó said Harry quie
tly, ÒMcLaggen looks like he 
was Confunded this morning. And he
 was standing right in front 
of where you were sitting.Ó 
Hermione blushed. 
ÒOh, all right then, I did it,Ó 
she whispered. ÒBut you should 
have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Any-
way, heÕs got a nasty temper, yo
u saw how he reacted when he 
didnÕt get in Ñ you wo
uldnÕt have wanted someone like that on 
the team.Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry. ÒNo, I suppose th
atÕs true. But wasnÕt that dis-
honest, Hermione? I mean, youÕ
re a prefect, arenÕt you?Ó 
ÒOh, be quiet,Ó she snap
ped, as he smirked. 
ÒWhat are you two doing?Ó demand
ed Ron, reappearing in the 
doorway to the Great Hall 
and looking suspicious. 
ÒNothing,Ó said Harry and Herm
ione together, and they hurried 
after Ron. The smell of roast beef 
made HarryÕs stomach ache with 
hunger, but they had barely taken 
three steps toward the Gryffin- 
 #'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,99" dor table when Professor Slughorn
 appeared in front of them, 
blocking their path. 
ÒHarry, Harry, just the man I was 
hoping to see!Ó he boomed ge-
nially, twiddling the ends of his 
walrus mustache and puffing out 
his enormous belly. ÒI was hoping 
to catch you before dinner! What 
do you say to a spot of supper toni
ght in my rooms instead? WeÕre 
having a little party, just a few 
rising stars, IÕve got McLaggen com-
ing and Zabini, the charming Me
linda Bobbin Ñ I donÕt know 
whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothe-
caries Ñ and, of course, I hope
 very much that Miss Granger will 
favor me by coming too.Ó 
Slughorn made Hermione a little bo
w as he finished speaking. It 
was as though Ron was not present
; Slughorn did not so much as 
look at him. 
ÒI canÕt come, Professor,Ó said 
Harry at once. ÒIÕve got a deten-
tion with Prof
essor Snape.Ó 
ÒOh dear!Ó said Slughorn, his face
 falling comically. ÒDear, dear, I 
was counting on you, Harry! Well, no
w, IÕll just have to have a word 
with Severus and explain the situation. IÕm sure IÕll be able to per-
suade him to postpone your detentio
n. Yes, IÕll see you both later!Ó 
He bustled away out of the Hall. 
ÒHeÕs got no chance of persuadi
ng Snape,Ó said Harry, the mo-
ment Slughorn was out of earshot. ÒThis detentionÕs already been 
postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he wonÕt do it 
for anyone else.Ó 
ÒOh, I wish you could come, I don
Õt want to go on my own!Ó 
said Hermione anxiously; Harry k
new that she was thinking about 
McLaggen. 
 !#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,9:" ÒI doubt youÕll be alone, GinnyÕ
ll probably be invited,Ó snapped 
Ron, who did not seem to have ta
ken kindly to being ignored by 
Slughorn. 
After dinner they made their way 
back to Gryffindor Tower. The 
common room was very crowded, as most people had finished din-
ner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; 
Ron, who had been in a bad mood 
ever since the encounter with 
Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione 
reached out for 
a copy of the 
Evening Prophet,
 which somebody 
had left abandoned on a chair. 
ÒAnything new?Ó said Harry. 
ÒNot really . . .Ó Hermione ha
d opened the newspaper and was 
scanning the inside pages. ÒOh, look, your dadÕs in here, Ron Ñ 
heÕs all right!Ó she added quickly,
 for Ron had looked around in 
alarm. ÒIt just says heÕs been to visit the MalfoysÕ house. Ô
This sec-
ond search of the Death EaterÕs residence does not seem to have yielded 
any results. Arthur Weasley of the 
Office for the Detection and Confis-
cation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that 
his team had been acting up
on a confidential tip-off.
ÕÓ 
ÒYeah, mine!Ó said Harry. ÒI to
ld him at KingÕs Cross about Mal-
foy and that thing he was trying to 
get Borgin to fix! Well, if itÕs not 
at their house, he must have brou
ght whatever it is to Hogwarts 
with him ÑÓ 
ÒBut how can he have done, 
Harry?Ó said Hermione, putting 
down the newspaper with a surprise
d look. ÒWe were all searched 
when we arrived, werenÕt we?Ó 
ÒWere you?Ó said Harry, ta
ken aback. ÒI wasnÕt!Ó 
ÒOh no, of course you werenÕt, I 
forgot you were late. . . . Well, 
Filch ran over all of us with Se
crecy Sensors when we got into the 
#'(/01+'23"#')%0+4""#$+5"
 ,9;" entrance hall. Any Dark object wo
uld have been found, I know for 
a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head
 confiscated. So you see, Malfoy 
canÕt have brought in anything dangerous!Ó 
Momentarily stymied, Harry wa
tched Ginny Weasley playing 
with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a 
while before seeing a way around 
this objection. 
ÒSomeoneÕs sent it to him by owl, then,Ó he said. ÒHis mother or 
someone.Ó 
ÒAll the owls are being checked to
o,Ó said Hermione. ÒFilch told 
us so when he was jabbing thos
e Secrecy Sensors everywhere he 
could reach.Ó 
Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. 
There did not seem to be any wa
y Malfoy could have brought a 
dangerous or Dark object into th
e school. He looked hopefully at 
Ron, who was sitting with his arms 
folded, staring over at Lavender 
Brown. ÒCan you think of any way Malfoy Ñ ?Ó 
ÒOh, drop it, Harry,Ó said Ron. 
ÒListen, itÕs not my fault Slug
horn invited Hermione and me to 
his stupid party, neither of us wa
nted to go, you know!Ó said Harry, 
firing up. 
ÒWell, as IÕm not invited to any parties,Ó said Ron, getting to his 
feet again, ÒI thin
k IÕll go to bed.Ó 
He stomped off toward the door 
to the boysÕ dormitories, leav-
ing Harry and Hermione staring after him. 
ÒHarry?Ó said the new Chaser, 
Demelza Robins, appearing sud-
denly at his 
shoulder. ÒIÕve got 
a message for you.Ó 
ÒFrom Professor Slughorn?Ó asked 
Harry, sitting 
up hopefully. 
ÒNo . . . from Professor Snape,Ó said Demelza. HarryÕs heart 
!#$%&'(""')'*'+"
 ,9<" sank. ÒHe says youÕre to come to hi
s office at half 
past eight tonight 
to do your detention Ñ er Ñ no

ed you to know youÕll be sorting 
out rotten flobberworms from good

ÒRight,Ó said Harry grimly

   here was Dumbledore, and 
what was he doing? Harry 
caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next 
few weeks. He rarely appeared 
at meals anymore, and Harry was 
sure Hermione was right in thinking
 that he was leaving the school 
for days at a time. Had Dumbledor
e forgotten the lessons he was 
supposed to be giving Harry? Dumb
ledore had said that the lessons 
were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt 
bolstered, comforted,
 and now he felt slightly abandoned. 
Halfway through October came thei
r first trip of the term to 
Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered wh
ether these trips would still 
be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around 
the school, but was please
d to know that they were going ahead; it 
was always good to get out of the 
castle grounds for a few hours. Harry woke early on the morning 
of the trip, which was proving 
stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his 
copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 He did not usually lie in bed 
)"!#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,-4" reading his textbooks; that sort of
 behavior, as Ron rightly said, was 
indecent in anybody except Herm
ione, who was simply weird that 
way. Harry felt, however, that th
e Half-Blood PrinceÕs copy of 
Ad-vanced Potion-Making
 hardly qualified as a textbook. The more 
Harry pored over the b
ook, the more he realiz
ed how much was in 
there, not only the handy hints an
d shortcuts on po
tions that were 
earning him such a glowing reputati
on with Slughorn, but also the 
imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which 
Harry was sure, judging by the crossi
ngs-out and revisions, that the 
Prince had invented himself. 
Harry had already atte
mpted a few of the PrinceÕs self-invented 
spells. There had been a hex that 
caused toenails to grow alarm-
ingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very en-
tertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the 
mouth (which he had twice used, 
to general applause, on an un-
suspecting Argus Filch); and, 
perhaps most useful of all, 
Muffliato,
 a spell that filled the ears of 
anyone nearby with an unidentifiable 
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with-
out being overheard. The only 
person who did not find these 
charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disap-
proving expression throughout and 
refused to talk at all if Harry 
had used the 
Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. 
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to ex-
amine more closely the scribbled 
instructions fo
r a spell that 
seemed to have caused the Prince
 some trouble. There were many 
crossings-out and alterations, but fi
nally, crammed into a corner of 
the page, the scribble: 
!"#$%&'()*+,-#./0
+/0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,-5" While the wind and sleet pounde
d relentlessly on the windows, 
and Neville snored loudly, Harry star
ed at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . that had to mean Ònonve
rbal.Ó Harry rather doubted he 
would be able to bring off this part
icular spell; he was still having 
difficulty with nonverbal spells
, something Snape had been quick 
to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the 
Prince had proved a much more effe
ctive teacher than Snape so far. 
Pointing his wand at nothing in pa
rticular, he gave it an upward 
flick and said 
Levicorpus! inside his head. 
ÒAaaaaaaargh!Ó There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Every-
one had woken up as Ron ha
d let out a yell. Harry sent 
Advanced 
Potion-Making
 flying in panic; Ron wa
s dangling upside down in 
midair as though an invisible 
hook had hoisted him up by the 
ankle. ÒSorry!Ó yelled Harry, as Dean and 
Seamus roared with laughter, 
and Neville picked hims
elf up from the floor, having fallen out of 
bed. ÒHang on Ñ IÕ
ll let you down ÑÓ He groped for the potion book an
d riffled through it in a panic, 
trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered 
one cramped word underneath the sp
ell: Praying that this was the 
counter-jinx, Harry thought 
Liberacorpus! with all his might. 
There was another flash of light, 
and Ron fell in a heap onto his 
mattress. ÒSorry,Ó repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus contin-
ued to roar with laughter. 
ÒTomorrow,Ó said Ron in a muffled 
voice, ÒIÕd rather you set the 
alarm clock.Ó By the time they had got dresse
d, padding themselves out with 
!#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,67" several of Mrs. WeasleyÕs hand-k
nitted sweaters and carrying 
cloaks, scarves, and gloves, RonÕ
s shock had subsided and he had 
decided that HarryÕs new spell was hi
ghly amusing; so amusing, in 
fact, that he lost no time in re
galing Hermione with the story as 
they sat down for breakfast. 
Ò. . . and then there was another 
flash of light and I landed on 
the bed again!Ó Ron grinned, 
helping himself to sausages. 
Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and 
now turned an expression of 
wintry disapproval upon Harry. 
ÒWas this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion 
book of yours?Ó she asked. 
Harry frowned at her. 
ÒAlways jump to the worst conclusion, donÕt you?Ó 
ÒWas it?Ó 
ÒWell . . . yeah, it 
was, but so what?Ó 
ÒSo you just decided to try ou
t an unknown, handwritten in-
cantation and see wh
at would happen?Ó 
ÒWhy does it matter if itÕs hand
written?Ó said Harry, preferring 
not to answer the rest of the question. 
ÒBecause itÕs probably not Ministry of MagicÐapproved,Ó said 
Hermione. ÒAnd also,Ó she added,
 as Harry and Ron rolled their 
eyes, Òbecause IÕm starting to thin
k this Prince character was a bit 
dodgy.Ó Both Harry and Ron shou
ted her down at once. 
ÒIt was a laugh!Ó said Ron, upend
ing a ketchup bottle over his 
sausages. ÒJust a 
laugh, Hermione, thatÕs all!Ó 
ÒDangling people upside down by the ankle?Ó said Hermi-
one. ÒWho puts their time and ener
gy into making up spells like 
that?Ó /0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,68" ÒFred and George,Ó said Ron, shru
gging, ÒitÕs their kind of thing. 
And, er ÑÓ 
ÒMy dad,Ó said Harry. He 
had only just remembered. 
ÒWhat?Ó said Ron and Hermione together. 
ÒMy dad used this spell,Ó said 
Harry. ÒI Ñ Lupin told me.Ó 
This last part was not true; in 
fact, Harry had seen his father use 
the spell on Snape, but he had 
never told Ron and Hermione about 
that particular excursion into th
e Pensieve. Now, however, a won-
derful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince 
possibly be Ñ ? 
ÒMaybe your dad did use it, Harr
y,Ó said Hermione, Òbut heÕs 
not the only one. WeÕve seen a whole 
bunch of people use it, in case 
youÕve forgotten. Dangling people
 in the air. Making them float 
along, asleep, helpless.Ó 
Harry stared at her. With a sink
ing feeling, he too remembered 
the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron 
came to his aid. 
ÒThat was different,Ó he said ro
bustly. ÒThey were abusing it. 
Harry and his dad were just having
 a laugh. You donÕt like the 
Prince, Hermione,Ó he added, poin
ting a sausage at her sternly, 
Òbecause heÕs better th
an you at Potions ÑÓ ÒItÕs got nothing to do with that!Ó said Hermione, her cheeks 
reddening. ÒI just think itÕs very 
irresponsible to start performing 
spells when you donÕt even know what theyÕre for, and stop talking 
about Ôthe PrinceÕ as if itÕs his titl
e, I bet itÕs just a stupid nickname, 
and it doesnÕt seem as though he was a very nice person to me!Ó 
ÒI donÕt see where you get that 
from,Ó said Harry heatedly. ÒIf 
heÕd been a budding Death Eater 
he wouldnÕt have been boasting 
about being Ôhalf-bl
ood,Õ would he?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,6," Even as he said it, Harry reme
mbered that his father had been 
pure-blood, but he pushed the th
ought out of his mind; he would 
worry about that later. . . . 
ÒThe Death Eaters canÕt all be pure-blood, there arenÕt enough 
pure-blood wizards left,Ó
 said Hermione stubbornly. ÒI expect most 
of them are half-bloods
 pretending to be pure. ItÕs only Muggle-
borns they hate, theyÕd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.Ó 
ÒThere is no way theyÕd let me be a Death Eater!Ó said Ron in-
dignantly, a bit of sausage flying 
off the fork he was now brandish-
ing at Hermione and hitting Erni
e Macmillan on the head. ÒMy 
whole family are blood traitors! That
Õs as bad as Muggle-borns to 
Death Eaters!Ó 
ÒAnd theyÕd love to have me,Ó 
said Harry sarcastically. ÒWeÕd be 
best pals if they didnÕt 
keep trying to do me in.Ó 
This made Ron laugh; even Herm
ione gave a grudging smile, 
and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny. 
ÒHey, Harry, IÕm 
supposed to give you this.Ó 
It was a scroll of parchment with
 HarryÕs name written upon it 
in familiar thin, 
slanting writing. 
ÒThanks, Ginny . . . ItÕs DumbledoreÕs next lesson!Ó Harry told 
Ron and Hermione, pulling open 
the parchment and quickly read-
ing its contents. ÒMonday evenin
g!Ó He felt suddenly light and 
happy. ÒWant to join us in 
Hogsmeade, Ginny?Ó he asked. 
ÒIÕm going with Dean Ñ might see you there,Ó she replied, wav-
ing at them as she left. 
Filch was standing at the oak fr
ont doors as usual, checking off 
the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. 
The process took even longer th
an normal as Filch was triple-
checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor. 
/0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,6-" ÒWhat does it matter if weÕre smuggling Dark stuff OUT?Ó de-
manded Ron, eyeing the long thin
 Secrecy Sensor with apprehen-
sion. ÒSurely you ought 
to be checking what we bring back IN?Ó 
His cheek earned him a few extra 
jabs with the Sensor, and he 
was still wincing as they steppe
d out into the wind and sleet. 
The walk into Hogsmeade was 
not enjoyable. Harry wrapped 
his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw 
and numb. The road to the village 
was full of students bent double 
against the bitter wind. More th
an once Harry wondered whether 
they might not have had a better 
time in the warm common room, 
and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that ZonkoÕs 
Joke Shop had been boarded up, 
Harry took it as confirmation 
that this trip was not destined 
to be fun. Ron pointed, with a 
thickly gloved hand, toward Ho
neydukes, which was mercifully 
open, and Harry and Hermione sta
ggered in his wake into the 
crowded shop. 
ÒThank God,Ó shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, 
toffee-scented air. ÒLetÕs stay here all afternoon.Ó 
ÒHarry, mÕboy!Ó said a boom
ing voice from behind them. 
ÒOh no,Ó muttered Harry. The thr
ee of them turned to see Pro-
fessor Slughorn, who was wearin
g an enormous furry hat and an 
overcoat with matching fur collar, 
clutching a large bag of crystal-
ized pineapple, and occupying at
 least a quarter of the shop. 
ÒHarry, thatÕs three of my little suppers youÕve missed now!Ó said 
Slughorn, poking him genially in 
the chest. ÒIt wonÕt do, mÕboy, 
IÕm determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, donÕt you?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Hermione helplessly, ÒtheyÕre really ÑÓ 
ÒSo why donÕt yo
u come along, Harry?
Ó demanded Slughorn. 
ÒWell, IÕve had Quidditch practi
ce, Professor,Ó said Harry, who 
!#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,66" had indeed been scheduling practice
s every time Slughorn had sent 
him a little, violet ri
bbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant 
that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, 
imagining Hermione shut up 
with McLaggen and Zabini. 
ÒWell, I certainly expect you to wi
n your first match after all this 
hard work!Ó said Slughorn. ÒBut a 
little recreation never hurt any-
body. Now, how about Monday nigh
t, you canÕt possibly want to 
practice in this 
weather. . . .Ó 
ÒI canÕt, Professor, IÕve got Ñ 
er Ñ an appointment with Profes-
sor Dumbledore that evening.Ó 
ÒUnlucky again!Ó cried Slughorn dramatically. ÒAh, well . . . you 
canÕt evade me fo
rever, Harry!Ó 
And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as lit-
tle notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach 
Clusters. ÒI canÕt believe youÕve wriggled 
out of another one,Ó said Hermi-
one, shaking her head. ÒTheyÕre not 
that bad, you know. . . . TheyÕre 
even quite fun sometimes. . . .Ó Bu
t then she caught sight of RonÕs 
expression. ÒOh, look Ñ theyÕve 
got deluxe sugar quills Ñ those 
would last hours!Ó 
Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed 
much more interest in the new ex
tra-large sugar quills than he 
would normally have done, but Ro
n continued to look moody and 
merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to 
go next. 
ÒLetÕs go to the Three Broomsticks
,Ó said Harry. ÒItÕll be warm.Ó 
They bundled their scarves back 
over their faces and left the 
sweetshop. The bitter wind was like
 knives on their faces after the 
sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The 
street was not very busy; no-
/0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,69" body was lingering to chat, just 
hurrying toward their destinations. 
The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just 
outside the Three Broomsticks. One 
was very tall and thin; squint-
ing through his rain-washed glasse
s Harry recognized the barman 
who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the HogÕs Head. As 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew clos
er, the barman drew his cloak 
more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter 
man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet 
from him when Harry realized who the man was. 
ÒMundungus!Ó The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair 
jumped and dropped an ancient su
itcase, which burst open, releas-
ing what looked like the entire 
contents of a ju
nk shop window. 
ÒOh, Õello, ÕArry,Ó said Mundungu
s Fletcher, with a most un-
convincing stab at airiness. ÒWell, donÕt let me keep ya.Ó 
And he began scrabbling on the 
ground to retrieve the contents 
of his suitcase with every appear
ance of a man eager to be gone. 
ÒAre you selling this stuff?Ó 
asked Harry, watching Mundungus 
grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground. 
ÒOh, well, gotta scrape a living,Ó said Mundungus. ÒGimme 
that!Ó Ron had stooped down and pi
cked up something silver. 
ÒHang on,Ó Ron said slowly
. ÒThis looks familiar ÑÓ 
ÒThank you!Ó said Mundungus, 
snatching the goblet out of 
RonÕs hand and stuffing it back into the case. ÒWell, IÕll see you 
all Ñ OUCH!Ó 
Harry had pinned Mundungus ag
ainst the wall of the pub by 
the throat. Holding him fast wi
th one hand, he pulled out his 
wand. !#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,6:" ÒHarry!Ó squeal
ed Hermione. 
ÒYou took that from SiriusÕs ho
use,Ó said Harry, who was almost 
nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant 
smell of old tobacco an
d spirits. ÒThat had th
e Black family crest 
on it.Ó ÒI Ñ no Ñ what Ñ ?Ó spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly 
turning purple. 
ÒWhat did you do, go back the 
night he died and strip the 
place?Ó snarled Harry. 
ÒI Ñ no ÑÓ 
ÒGive it to me!Ó 
ÒHarry, you mustnÕt!Ó shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus 
started to turn blue. 
There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off MundungusÕs 
throat. Gasping and spluttering, 
Mundungus seized his fallen case, 
then Ñ 
CRACK Ñ he Disapparated. 
Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see 
where Mundungus had gone. 
ÒCOME BACK, YOU THIEVING Ñ !Ó 
ÒThereÕs no point, Harry.Ó 
Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with 
sleet. ÒMundungus will probably be in
 London by now. ThereÕs no 
point yelling.Ó 
ÒHeÕs nicked SiriusÕs 
stuff! Nicked it!Ó 
ÒYes, but still,Ó said Tonks, who 
seemed perfectly untroubled by 
this piece of informat
ion. ÒYou should get out of the cold.Ó 
She watched them go through 
the door of the Three Broom-
sticks. /0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,6." The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, Ò
He was nicking 
SiriusÕs stuff
!Ó ÒI know, Harry, but please donÕt sh
out, people are staring,Ó whis-
pered Hermione. ÒGo and sit do
wn, IÕll get you a drink.Ó 
Harry was still fuming when Hermio
ne returned to their table a 
few minutes later holding th
ree bottles of butterbeer. 
ÒCanÕt the Order control Mundungus?Ó Harry demanded of the 
other two in a furious whisper. ÒCan
Õt they at least stop him steal-
ing everything thatÕs not fixed down when heÕs at headquarters?Ó 
ÒShh!Ó said Hermione desperately,
 looking around to make sure 
nobody was listening; there were a 
couple of warlocks sitting close 
by who were staring at Harry with
 great interest, and Zabini was 
lolling against a pillar
 not far away. ÒHarry, IÕd be annoyed too, I 
know itÕs your things heÕs stealing ÑÓ 
Harry gagged on his butterbeer; 
he had momentarily forgotten 
that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place. 
ÒYeah, itÕs my stuff!Ó he said. 
ÒNo wonder he wasnÕt pleased to 
see me! Well, IÕm going to tell Dumbledore whatÕs going on, heÕs 
the only one who scares Mundungus.Ó 
ÒGood idea,Ó whispered Hermione
, clearly pleased that Harry 
was calming down. ÒRon, what are you staring at?Ó 
ÒNothing,Ó said Ron, hastily look
ing away from the bar, but Harry 
knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive bar-
maid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. 
ÒI expect ÔnothingÕsÕ in the back getting more firewhisky,Ó said 
Hermione waspishly. 
Ron ignored this jibe, sipping hi
s drink in what he evidently 
considered to be a dignified sile
nce. Harry was thinking about Sir-
ius, and how he had hated those 
silver goblets anyway. Hermione 
!#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,64" drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron 
and the bar. The moment Harry dr
ained the last dr
ops in his bot-
tle she said, ÒShall we call it a day and go back to school, then?Ó 
The other two nodded; it had 
not been a fun trip and the 
weather was getting worse the longer
 they stayed. Once again they 
drew their cloaks tightly around 
them, rearranged their scarves, 
pulled on their gloves, then followed
 Katie Bell and 
a friend out of 
the pub and back up the High St
reet. HarryÕs thoughts strayed to 
Ginny as they trudged up the road
 to Hogwarts through the frozen 
slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, 
because she and Dean were cozily
 closeted in Madam PuddifootÕs 
Tea Shop, that haunt of happy co
uples. Scowling, he bowed his 
head against the swirling sleet and trudged on. 
It was a little while 
before Harry became awar
e that the voices of 
Katie Bell and her friend, which we
re being carried back to him on 
the wind, had become shriller an
d louder. Harry squinted at their 
indistinct figures. The two girls 
were having an argument about 
something Katie was holding in he
r hand. ÒItÕs nothing to do with 
you, Leanne!Ó Harr
y heard Katie say. 
They rounded a corner in the la
ne, sleet coming thick and fast, 
blurring HarryÕs glasses. 
Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe 
them, Leanne made to grab hold of
 the package Katie was holding; 
Katie tugged it back and the 
package fell to the ground. 
At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended 
comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as 
though she was about to fly. Yet 
there was something wrong, some-
thing eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce 
wind, but her eyes were closed an
d her face was qu
ite empty of  
 /0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,65" expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione,
 and Leanne had all halted in 
their tracks, watching. 
Then, six feet above the ground, 
Katie let out a terrible scream. 
Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was 
feeling, was clearly causing her terr
ible anguish. She screamed and 
screamed; Leanne started to scream
 too and seized KatieÕs ankles, 
trying to tug her back to the 
ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed KatieÕs legs, she 
fell on top of them; Harry and Ro
n managed to catch her but she 
was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they low-
ered her to the ground where sh
e thrashed and screamed, appar-
ently unable to recognize any of them. 
Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. 
ÒStay there!Ó he shouted at the 
others over the howling wind. 
ÒIÕm going for help!Ó 
He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone 
behave as Katie had just behave
d and could not think what had 
caused it; he hurtled around a b
end in the lane and collided with 
what seemed to be an enor
mous bear on its hind legs. 
ÒHagrid!Ó he panted, disentangl
ing himself from the hedgerow 
into which he had fallen. 
ÒHarry!Ó said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and 
beard, and was wearing his great, 
shaggy beaverskin
 coat. ÒJusÕ bin 
visitinÕ Grawp, heÕs cominÕ 
on so well ye
h wouldnÕ ÑÓ 
ÒHagrid, someoneÕs hurt back there, or cursed, or something ÑÓ 
ÒWha?Ó said Hagrid, bending lowe
r to hear what Harry was say-
ing over the raging wind. 
ÒSomeoneÕs been cursed
!Ó bellowed Harry. 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,97" ÒCursed? WhoÕs bin cursed Ñ not Ron? Hermione?Ó 
ÒNo, itÕs not them, itÕs Ka
tie Bell Ñ this way . . .Ó 
Together they ran back along the 
lane. It took them no time to 
find the little group of people arou
nd Katie, who was still writhing 
and screaming on the ground; Ro
n, Hermione, and Leanne were 
all trying to quiet her. 
ÒGet back!Ó shouted Hagrid. ÒLemme see her!Ó 
ÒSomethingÕs happened to her!Ó so
bbed Leanne. ÒI donÕt know 
what ÑÓ 
Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent 
down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with 
her. Within seconds, KatieÕs pier
cing screams had died away and 
the only sound was the roar of the wind. 
Hermione hurried over to KatieÕs wailing friend and put an arm 
around her. 
ÒItÕs Leanne, isnÕt it?Ó 
The girl nodded. 
ÒDid it just happen all of a sudden, or Ñ ?Ó 
ÒIt was when that package tore,Ó sobbed Leanne, pointing at the 
now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split 
open to reveal a greenish glitte
r. Ron bent down, his hand out-
stretched, but Harry seized 
his arm and pulled him back. 
ÒDonÕt touch it
!Ó He crouched down. An ornate opal
 necklace was visible, poking 
out of the paper. 
ÒIÕve seen that before,Ó said Harry
, staring at the thing. ÒIt was 
on display in Borgin and Burkes 
ages ago. The label said it was 
cursed. Katie must have touched it.Ó He looked up at Leanne, who  
 /0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,98" had started to shake uncontrollab
ly. ÒHow did Katie get hold of 
this?Ó ÒWell, thatÕs why we were argu
ing. She came back from the 
bathroom in the Three Broomsticks
 holding it, said it was a sur-
prise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She 
looked all funny when she said it
. . . . Oh no, oh no, I bet sheÕd 
been Imperiused and 
I didnÕt realize!Ó 
Leanne shook with renewed sobs. 
Hermione patted her shoulder 
gently. 
ÒShe didnÕt say whoÕd given it to her, Leanne?Ó 
ÒNo . . . she wouldnÕt te
ll me . . . and I said
 she was being stupid 
and not to take it up to school, bu
t she just wouldnÕt
 listen and . . . 
and then I tried to grab it 
from her . . . and Ñ and ÑÓ 
Leanne let out a wail of despair. 
ÒWeÕd better get up to school,Ó
 said Hermione, her arm still 
around Leanne. ÒWeÕll be able to fi
nd out how she is. Come on. . . .Ó 
Harry hesitated for a moment, then 
pulled his scarf from around 
his face and, ignoring RonÕs gasp
, carefully covered the necklace in 
it and picked it up. 
ÒWeÕll need to show this 
to Madam Pomfrey,Ó he said. 
As they followed Hermione and 
Leanne up the road, Harry was 
thinking furiously. They had ju
st entered the grounds when he 
spoke, unable to keep his th
oughts to himself any longer. 
ÒMalfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and 
Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was 
hiding from him and his dad. 
This is what he was buying that day 
when we followed him! He remembered
 it and he went back for it!Ó 
ÒI Ñ I dunno, Harry,Ó said Ron he
sitantly. ÒLoads 
of people go  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,9," to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didnÕt
 that girl say Katie got it in the 
girlsÕ bathroom?Ó 
ÒShe said she came back from th
e bathroom with it, she didnÕt 
necessarily get it in th
e bathroom itself ÑÓ 
ÒMcGonagall!Ó said Ron warningly. 
Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hur-
rying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them. 
ÒHagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell Ñ 
upstairs to my office at once, pl
ease! WhatÕs that youÕre holding, 
Potter?Ó ÒItÕs the thing she touched,Ó said Harry. 
ÒGood lord,Ó said Professor McGo
nagall, looking 
alarmed as she 
took the necklace from Harry. ÒNo, 
no, Filch, theyÕre with me!Ó she 
added hastily, as Filch came sh
uffling eagerly ac
ross the entrance 
hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. ÒTake this necklace to Profes-
sor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in 
the scarf!Ó 
Harry and the others followed Pr
ofessor McGonagall upstairs 
and into her office. The sleet-spa
ttered windows were rattling in 
their frames, and the room was chil
ly despite the fire crackling in 
the grate. Professor McGonagall 
closed the door and swept around 
her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing 
Leanne. 
ÒWell?Ó she said sharply. ÒWhat happened?Ó 
Haltingly, and with many pauses
 while she attempted to control 
her crying, Leanne told Professo
r McGonagall how Katie had gone 
to the bathroom in the Three Br
oomsticks and returned holding 
the unmarked package, how Katie 
had seemed a little odd, and  
 /0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,9-" how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver 
unknown objects, the argument cu
lminating in the tussle over the 
parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, 
there was no getting anot
her word out of her. 
ÒAll right,Ó said Professor McGo
nagall, not unkindly, Ògo up to 
the hospital wing, please, Leanne,
 and get Madam Pomfrey to give 
you something for shock.Ó 
When she had left the room, Pro
fessor McGonagall turned back 
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 
ÒWhat happened when Kati
e touched the necklace?Ó 
ÒShe rose up in the air,Ó said Ha
rry, before either Ron or Hermi-
one could speak, Òand then began to scream, and collapsed. Profes-
sor, can I see Professo
r Dumbledore, please?Ó 
ÒThe headmaster is away until 
Monday, Potter,Ó said Professor 
McGonagall, looking surprised. 
ÒAway?Ó Harry repeated angrily. 
ÒYes, Potter, away!Ó said Profe
ssor McGonagall tartly. ÒBut any-
thing you have to say about this 
horrible business can be said to 
me, IÕm sure!Ó 
For a split second, Harry hesitate
d. Professor McGonagall did 
not invite confidences; Dumbledore,
 though in many ways more 
intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however 
wild. This was a life-and-death ma
tter, though, and no moment to 
worry about being laughed at. 
ÒI think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.Ó 
On one side of him, Ron rubbed
 his nose in apparent embar-
rassment; on the other, Hermione 
shuffled her feet as though quite 
keen to put a bit of distance
 between herself and Harry. 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,96" ÒThat is a very serious accusation, Potter,Ó said Professor McGon-
agall, after a shoc
ked pause. ÒDo you have any proof?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry, Òbut . . .Ó and he told her about following 
Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and 
the conversation they had over-
heard between him and Mr. Borgin. 
When he had finished speaking, 
Professor McGonagall looked 
slightly confused. 
ÒMalfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?Ó 
ÒNo, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend 
something, he didnÕt have it with
 him. But thatÕs not the point, the 
thing is that he bought something 
at the same time, and I think it 
was that necklace ÑÓ 
ÒYou saw Malfoy leaving the sh
op with a similar package?Ó 
ÒNo, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him ÑÓ 
ÒBut Harry,Ó Hermione interrupted, ÒBorgin asked him if he 
wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no ÑÓ 
ÒBecause he didnÕt want to to
uch it, obviously!Ó said Harry 
angrily. 
ÒWhat he actually said was, ÔHow would I look carrying that 
down the street?ÕÓ said Hermione. 
ÒWell, he would look a bit of a 
prat carrying a necklace,Ó inter-
jected Ron. 
ÒOh, Ron,Ó said Hermione desp
airingly, Òit would be all 
wrapped up, so he wouldnÕt have to
 touch it, and quite easy to hide 
inside a cloak, so nobody would s
ee it! I think whatever he reserved 
at Borgin and Burkes
 was noisy or bulky,
 something he knew 
would draw attention to him if he 
carried it down the street Ñ and 
in any case,Ó she pres
sed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, 
ÒI asked Borgin about the neck
lace, donÕt you remember? When I 
/0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,99" went in to try and find out what
 Malfoy had asked him to keep, I 
saw it there. And Borgin just told 
me the price, he didnÕt say it was 
already sold or anything ÑÓ 
ÒWell, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were 
up to within about five seconds, of
 course he wasnÕt going to tell 
you Ñ anyway, Malfoy couldÕve
 sent off for it since ÑÓ 
ÒThatÕs enough!Ó said Profe
ssor McGonagall, as Hermione 
opened her mouth to retort, looking 
furious. ÒPotter, I appreciate 
you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. 
Malfoy purely because 
he visited the shop 
where this necklace 
might have been purchased. The same
 is probably true of hundreds 
of people ÑÓ 
ÒÑ thatÕs what I said
 ÑÓ muttered Ron. 
ÒÑ and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in 
place this year. I do not believe th
at necklace can possibly have en-
tered this school without our knowledge ÑÓ 
ÒBut ÑÓ 
ÒÑ and what is more,Ó said Pr
ofessor McGonagall
, with an air 
of awful finality, ÒMr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.Ó 
Harry gaped at he
r, deflating. 
ÒHow do you know, Professor?Ó 
ÒBecause he was doing detention 
with me. He has now failed to 
complete his Transfiguration home
work twice in a row. So, thank 
you for telling me your suspicions
, Potter,Ó she said as she marched 
past them, Òbut I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check 
on Katie Bell. Good 
day to you all.Ó 
She held open her office door. They
 had no choice
 but to file 
past her without another word. 
Harry was angry with the other tw
o for siding with McGonagall; 
!#$%&'(""&)'*+'"
 ,9:" nevertheless, he felt compelled to
 join in once they started dis-
cussing what had happened. 
ÒSo who do you reckon Katie wa
s supposed to give the necklace 
to?Ó asked Ron, as th
ey climbed the stairs 
to the common room. 
ÒGoodness only knows,Ó said He
rmione. ÒBut wh
oever it was 
has had a narrow escape. No one 
could have opened that package 
without touching the necklace.Ó 
ÒIt couldÕve been mean
t for loads of people,Ó said Harry. ÒDum-
bledore Ñ the Death Eaters would lo
ve to get rid of him, he must 
be one of their top targets. Or
 Slughorn Ñ Dumbledore reckons 
Voldemort really wanted him and th
ey canÕt be pleased that heÕs 
sided with Dumb
ledore. Or ÑÓ 
ÒOr you,Ó said Hermione, looking troubled. 
ÒCouldnÕt have been,Ó said Harry, 
Òor Katie wouldÕve just turned 
around in the lane and given it to
 me, wouldnÕt she? I was behind 
her all the way out of the Three 
Broomsticks. It would have made 
much more sense to deliver the pa
rcel outside Hogwarts, what with 
Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Mal-
foy told her to take it into the castle?Ó 
ÒHarry, Malfoy wasnÕt in Hogsme
ade!Ó said Hermione, actually 
stamping her foot in frustration. 
ÒHe must have used an accomp
lice, then,Ó said Harry. ÒCrabbe 
or Goyle Ñ or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, heÕll have 
loads better cronies th
an Crabbe and Goyle now heÕs joined up ÑÓ 
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said 
ThereÕs no 
point arguing with him.
 ÒDilligrout,Ó said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady. 
The portrait swung open to ad
mit them to the common room. 
It was quite full and smelled of
 damp clothing; many people 
/0*+'(""$12""3%$*/"
 ,9." seemed to have returned from Ho
gsmeade early because of the bad 
weather. There was no buzz of 
fear or speculation, however: 
Clearly, the news of KatieÕs fate had not yet spread. 
ÒIt wasnÕt a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think 
about it,Ó said Ron, casually turf
ing a first year out of one of the 
good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. ÒThe curse 
didnÕt even make it in
to the castle. Not what youÕd call foolproof.Ó 
ÒYouÕre right,Ó said Hermione, 
prodding Ron out of the chair 
with her foot and offering it to the first year again. ÒIt wasnÕt very 
well thought-out at all.Ó 
ÒBut since when has Malfoy been one of the worldÕs great 
thinkers?Ó asked Harry. 
Neither Ron nor Herm
ione answered him.

   atie was removed to St. MungoÕs Hospital for Magical 
Maladies and Injuries the follo
wing day, by which time the 
news that she had been cursed ha
d spread all over the school, 
though the details were confuse
d and nobody other than Harry, 
Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself 
had not been the intended target. 
ÒOh, and Malfoy knows, of course,Ó said Harry to Ron and Her-
mione, who continued their new 
policy of feigning deafness when-
ever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. 
Harry had wondered whether Du
mbledore would return from 
wherever he had been 
in time for Monday ni
ghtÕs lesson, but hav-
ing had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside 
DumbledoreÕs office at eight oÕcloc
k, knocked, and was told to en-
ter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as 
black and burned as ever, but he sm
iled when he gestured to Harry

 +,2" to sit down. The Pensieve was sittin
g on the desk again, casting sil-
very specks of light 
over the ceiling. 
ÒYou have had a busy time whil
e I have been away,Ó Dumble-
dore said. ÒI believe you wi
tnessed KatieÕ
s accident.Ó 
ÒYes, sir. How is she?Ó 
ÒStill very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears 
to have brushed the necklace with
 the smallest possible amount of 
skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she 
even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps 
instantly. Luckily Professor Snape 
was able to do enough to prevent 
a rapid spread of the curse ÑÓ 
ÒWhy him?Ó asked Harry quickly. ÒWhy not Madam Pomfrey?Ó 
ÒImpertinent,Ó said a soft voice 
from one of the portraits on the 
wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, SiriusÕs great-great-grandfather, 
raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. 
ÒI would not have permitted a st
udent to question the way Hog-
warts operated in my day.Ó 
ÒYes, thank you, Phineas,Ó said
 Dumbledore quellingly. ÒProfes-
sor Snape knows much more abou
t the Dark Arts than Madam 
Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. 
MungoÕs staff are sending me 
hourly reports, and I am hopeful 
that Katie will ma
ke a full recov-
ery in time.Ó 
ÒWhere were you this weekend, 
sir?Ó Harry asked, disregarding 
a strong feeling that he might be
 pushing his luck, a feeling appar-
ently shared by Phineas Ni
gellus, who hissed softly. 
ÒI would rather not say just now,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒHowever, 
I shall tell you in due course.Ó 
ÒYou will?Ó said Harry, startled. 
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +34" ÒYes, I expect so,Ó said Dumble
dore, withdrawing a fresh bottle 
of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a 
prod of his wand. 
ÒSir,Ó said Harry tentatively, ÒI
 met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.Ó 
ÒAh yes, I am already aware that
 Mundungus has been treating 
your inheritance with light-finger
ed contempt,Ó said Dumbledore, 
frowning a little. ÒHe has gone to
 ground since you accosted him 
outside the Three Broomsticks; I rath
er think he dreads facing me. 
However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any 
more of SiriusÕs old possessions.Ó 
ÒThat mangy old half-blood has b
een stealing Blac
k heirlooms?Ó 
said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; an
d he stalked out of his frame, 
undoubtedly to visit his portrait
 in number twelve, Grimmauld 
Place. ÒProfessor,Ó said Harry, after 
a short pause, 
Òdid Professor 
McGonagall tell you what I told
 her after Katie got hurt? About 
Draco Malfoy?Ó 
ÒShe told me of your suspicions, yes,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒAnd do you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒI shall take all appropriate me
asures to investigate anyone who 
might have had a hand in KatieÕs 
accident,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒBut 
what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.Ó 
Harry felt slightly resentful at this
: If their lessons were so very 
important, why had there been such
 a long gap between the first 
and second? However, he said no
 more about Draco Malfoy, but 
watched as Dumbledore poured th
e fresh memories into the Pen-
sieve and began swirling the st
one basin once more between his 
long-fingered hands. 
ÒYou will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +35" VoldemortÕs beginnings
 at the point where 
the handsome Muggle, 
Tom Riddle, had abandoned his wi
tch wife, Merope, and returned 
to his family home in Little Hang
leton. Merope was left alone in 
London, expecting the baby wh
o would one day become Lord 
Voldemort.Ó 
ÒHow do you know she 
was in London, sir?Ó ÒBecause of the evidence of o
ne Caractacus Burke,Ó said Dum-
bledore, Òwho, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop 
whence came the necklace we 
have just been discussing.Ó 
He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him 
swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out 
of the swirling, silvery mass rose a 
little old man revolving slowly in 
the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but 
much more solid, with a thatch 
of hair that complete
ly covered his eyes. 
ÒYes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in 
by a young witch just before Chri
stmas, oh, many years ago now. 
She said she needed the 
gold badly, well, that much was obvious. 
Covered in rags and pretty far alon
g . . . Going to have a baby, see. 
She said the locket had been Slytheri
nÕs. Well, we hear that sort of 
story all the time, ÔOh, this was MerlinÕs, this was, his favorite 
teapot,Õ but when I looked at it, it
 had his mark all right, and a few 
simple spells were enough to te
ll me the truth. Of course, that 
made it near enough priceless. She didnÕt seem to have any idea 
how much it was worth. Happy to 
get ten Galleons for it. Best bar-
gain we ever made!Ó 
Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Car-
actacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory 
from whence he had come. 
ÒHe only gave her ten Galleons
?Ó said Harry indignantly. 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +3+" ÒCaractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,Ó said Dum-
bledore. ÒSo we know that, near 
the end of her pregnancy, Merope 
was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate 
enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that 
was one of MarvoloÕs treasured family heirlooms.Ó 
ÒBut she could do magic!Ó said
 Harry impatiently. ÒShe could 
have got food and everything for he
rself by magic, couldnÕt she?Ó 
ÒAh,Ó said Dumbledore, Òperhaps she could. But it is my 
belief Ñ I am guessing again, bu
t I am sure I am right Ñ that 
when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I 
do not think that she wa
nted to be a witch any longer. Of course, 
it is also possible that her unrequ
ited love and the attendant despair 
sapped her of her powers; that can 
happen. In any case, as you are 
about to see, Merope refused to 
raise her wand even to save her 
own life.Ó 
ÒShe wouldnÕt even st
ay alive for her son?Ó 
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. 
ÒCould you possibly be feeling 
sorry for Lord Voldemort?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry quickly, Òbut sh
e had a choice, didnÕt she, not 
like my mother ÑÓ 
ÒYour mother had a choice too,
Ó said Dumbledore gently. ÒYes, 
Merope Riddle chose death in spit
e of a son who needed her, but 
do not judge her too harshly, Har
ry. She was greatly weakened by 
long suffering and she never had yo
ur motherÕs courage. And now, 
if you will stand . . .Ó 
ÒWhere are we going?Ó Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him 
at the front of the desk. 
ÒThis time,Ó said Dumbledore, Òwe are going to enter 
my   &#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +36" memory. I think you will fi
nd it both rich in detail and satisfyingly 
accurate. After you, Harry . . .Ó 
Harry bent over the Pensieve; his 
face broke the cool surface of 
the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . 
Seconds later, his feet hit firm
 ground; he opened his eyes and 
found that he and Dumbledore were
 standing in a bustling, old-
fashioned London street. 
ÒThere I am,Ó said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of 
them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn 
milk cart. 
This younger Albus DumbledoreÕ
s long hair and beard were 
auburn. Having reached their side of
 the street, he strode off along 
the pavement, drawing many curi
ous glances due to the flamboy-
antly cut suit of plum velv
et that he was wearing. 
ÒNice suit, sir,Ó said Harry, before he could stop himself, but 
Dumbledore merely chuckled as th
ey followed his younger self a 
short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare 
courtyard that fronted a rather 
grim, square building surrounded 
by high railings. He mounted the 
few steps leading to the front 
door and knocked once. After a 
moment or two, the door was 
opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron. 
ÒGood afternoon. I have an a
ppointment with a Mrs. Cole, 
who, I believe, is the matron here?Ó 
ÒOh,Ó said the bewildered-lookin
g girl, taking in DumbledoreÕs 
eccentric appearance. ÒUm . . . just a moÕ . . . MRS. COLE!Ó she 
bellowed over her shoulder. 
Harry heard a distant voice shou
ting something in response. 
The girl turned back to Dumbledo
re. ÒCome in, sheÕs on Õer way.Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +37" Dumbledore stepped into a hallway 
tiled in black and white; the 
whole place was shabby but spot
lessly clean. Harry and the older 
Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind 
them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward 
them. She had a sharp-featured face
 that appeared more anxious 
than unkind, and she was talking 
over her shoulder to another 
aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore. 
Ò. . . and take the iodine upstai
rs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has 
been picking his scabs and Eric WhalleyÕs oozing all over his 
sheets Ñ chicken pox on top of ev
erything else,Ó she said to no-
body in particular, and then he
r eyes fell upon Dumbledore and 
she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe 
had just crossed 
her threshold. 
ÒGood afternoon,Ó sa
id Dumbledore, holding out his hand. 
Mrs. Cole simply gaped. 
ÒMy name is Albus Dumbledore. 
I sent you a letter requesting 
an appointment and you very ki
ndly invited me here today.Ó 
Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was 
not a hallucination, she said fee
bly, ÒOh yes. Well Ñ well then Ñ 
youÕd better come in
to my room. Yes.Ó 
She led Dumbledore into a small r
oom that seemed part sitting 
room, part office. It was as shabby
 as the hallway and the furniture 
was old and mismatched. She invite
d Dumbledore to sit on a rick-
ety chair and seated herself behi
nd a cluttered desk, eyeing him 
nervously. 
ÒI am here, as I told you in my
 letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and 
arrangements for his future,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒAre you family?Ó 
asked Mrs. Cole. 
 &#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +3," ÒNo, I am a teacher,Ó said Dumb
ledore. ÒI have come to offer 
Tom a place at my school.Ó 
ÒWhat schoolÕs this, then?Ó 
ÒIt is called Hogwarts,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒAnd how come youÕre interested in Tom?Ó 
ÒWe believe he has qualities we are looking for.Ó 
ÒYou mean heÕs won a scholarship? How can he have done? HeÕs 
never been entered for one.Ó 
ÒWell, his name has been down for our school since birth ÑÓ 
ÒWho registered 
him? His parents?Ó 
There was no doubt that Mrs. Co
le was an inconveniently sharp 
woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now 
saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the 
same time picking up a piece of 
perfectly blank paper from Mrs. 
ColeÕs desktop. 
ÒHere,Ó said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed 
her the piece of paper, ÒI think th
is will make everything clear.Ó 
Mrs. ColeÕs eyes slid out of focu
s and back again as she gazed in-
tently at the blank 
paper for a moment. 
ÒThat seems perfectly in order,Ó she said placidly, handing it 
back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that 
had certainly not been pres
ent a few seconds before. 
ÒEr Ñ may I offer you a glass of
 gin?Ó she said in an extra-
refined voice. 
ÒThank you very much,Ó said Dumbledore, beaming. 
It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came 
to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she 
drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she  
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +33" smiled at Dumbledore for the first 
time, and he didnÕt hesitate to 
press his advantage. 
ÒI was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom 
RiddleÕs history? I think he wa
s born here in the orphanage?Ó 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Mrs. Cole, help
ing herself to more gin. ÒI re-
member it clear as anything, beca
use IÕd just started here myself. 
New YearÕs Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. 
And this girl, not much older than
 I was myself at
 the time, came 
staggering up the front steps. Well, 
she wasnÕt the first. We took her 
in, and she had the baby within th
e hour. And she was dead in an-
other hour.Ó 
Mrs. Cole nodded impressively 
and took another generous gulp 
of gin. ÒDid she say anything before 
she died?Ó asked Dumbledore. 
ÒAnything about the boyÕs 
father, for instance?Ó 
ÒNow, as it happens, she did,Ó said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be 
rather enjoying herself now, with 
the gin in her hand and an eager 
audience for her story. ÒI remember 
she said to me, ÔI hope he looks 
like his papa,Õ and I wonÕt lie, sh
e was right to hope it, because she 
was no beauty Ñ and then she told
 me he was to be named Tom, 
for his father, and Marvolo, for 
her father Ñ yes, I know, funny 
name, isnÕt it? We wondered whet
her she came from a circus Ñ 
and she said the boyÕs surname was 
to be Riddle. And she died soon 
after that without another word. ÒWell, we named him just as sheÕ
d said, it seemed so important 
to the poor girl, but no Tom no
r Marvolo nor any 
kind of Riddle 
ever came looking for him
, nor any family at all,
 so he stayed in the 
orphanage and heÕs been
 here ever since.Ó 
Mrs. Cole helped herself, almo
st absentmindedly, to another 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +38" healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her 
cheekbones. Then she sa
id, ÒHeÕs a funny boy.Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI
 thought he might be.Ó 
ÒHe was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And 
then, when he got a little 
older, he was . . . odd.Ó ÒOdd in what way?Ó aske
d Dumbledore gently. 
ÒWell, he ÑÓ 
But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or 
vague about the inquisitorial glan
ce she shot Dumbledore over her 
gin glass. 
ÒHeÕs definitely got a place at your school, you say?Ó 
ÒDefinitely,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒAnd nothing I say can change that?Ó 
ÒNothing,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒYouÕll be taking hi
m away, whatever?Ó 
ÒWhatever,Ó repeated Dumbledore gravely. 
She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust 
him. Apparently she decided she co
uld, because she said in a sud-
den rush, ÒHe scares 
the other children.Ó 
ÒYou mean he is a bully?Ó asked Dumbledore. 
ÒI think he must be,Ó said Mrs. 
Cole, frowning slightly, Òbut itÕs 
very hard to catch him at it. There 
have been incidents. . . . Nasty 
things . . .Ó 
Dumbledore did not press her, thou
gh Harry could tell that he 
was interested. She took yet anot
her gulp of gi
n and her rosy 
cheeks grew rosier still. 
ÒBilly StubbsÕs rabbit . . . well, Tom 
said he didnÕt do it and I 
donÕt see how he could have done, bu
t even so, it didn
Õt hang itself 
from the rafters, did it?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +3-" ÒI shouldnÕt think so, no,Ó said Dumbledore quietly. 
ÒBut IÕm jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I 
know is he and Billy had argued 
the day before. And thenÓ Ñ Mrs. 
Cole took another swig of gin, slo
pping a little over her chin this 
time Ñ Òon the summer outing Ñ 
we take them out, you know, 
once a year, to the countryside or
 to the seaside Ñ well, Amy Ben-
son and Dennis Bishop were neve
r quite right afterwards, and all 
we ever got out of them was that 
theyÕd gone into a cave with Tom 
Riddle. He swore theyÕd just gone exploring, but 
something
 hap-
pened in there, IÕm sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of 
things, funny things. . . .Ó 
She looked around at Dumbledore 
again, and though her cheeks 
were flushed, her gaze was steady. 
ÒI donÕt think many people will 
be sorry to see the back of him.Ó 
ÒYou understand, IÕm sure, that we will not be keeping him per-
manently?Ó said Dumbledore. ÒHe will have to return here, at the 
very least, every summer.Ó 
ÒOh, well, thatÕs better than a 
whack on the nose with a rusty 
poker,Ó said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and 
Harry was impressed to see that sh
e was quite steady, even though 
two-thirds of the gin was now gone.
 ÒI suppose youÕd like to see 
him?Ó ÒVery much,Ó said Dumb
ledore, risi
ng too. 
She led him out of her office and 
up the stone stairs, calling out 
instructions and admonitions to he
lpers and children as she passed. 
The orphans, Harry saw,
 were all wearing the same kind of grayish 
tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no 
denying that this was a grim 
place in which to grow up. 
ÒHere we are,Ó said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +32" landing and stopped outside the fi
rst door in a long corridor. She 
knocked twice and entered. 
ÒTom? YouÕve got a visitor. T
his is Mr. Dumberton Ñ sorry, 
Dunderbore. HeÕs come to tell 
you Ñ well, IÕll let him do it.Ó Harry and the two Dumbledores 
entered the room, and Mrs. 
Cole closed the door on them. It 
was a small bare room with noth-
ing in it except an old wardrobe
, a wooden chair, and an iron bed-
stead. A boy was sitting on top 
of the gray blankets, his legs 
stretched out in front 
of him, holding a book. 
There was no trace of the Gaunts
 in Tom RiddleÕs face. Merope 
had got her dying wish: He was his 
handsome father in miniature, 
tall for eleven years old, dark-hai
red, and pale. His eyes narrowed 
slightly as he took in Dumbledo
reÕs eccentric appearance. There 
was a momentÕs silence. 
ÒHow do you do, Tom?Ó said Dumbledore, walking forward and 
holding out his hand. 
The boy hesitated, then took 
it, and they shook hands. Dum-
bledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the 
pair of them looked 
rather like a hospital
 patient and visitor. 
ÒI am Professor Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒÔProfessorÕ?Ó repeated Riddle. 
He looked wary. ÒIs that like 
ÔdoctorÕ? What are you here for? Did 
she get you in to have a look 
at me?Ó 
He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just 
left. 
ÒNo, no,Ó said Dumbledore, smiling. 
ÒI donÕt believe you,Ó said Riddl
e. ÒShe wants me looked at, 
doesnÕt she? Tell the truth!Ó 
He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +84" almost shocking. It was a command,
 and it sounded as though he 
had given it many times before. 
His eyes had widened and he was 
glaring at Dumbledore, who made no
 response except to continue 
smiling pleasantly. After a few 
seconds Riddle stopped glaring, 
though he looked, if an
ything, warier still. 
ÒWho are you?Ó 
ÒI have told you. My name is
 Professor Dumbledore and I work 
at a school called Hogwarts. I have
 come to offer you a place at my 
school Ñ your new school, if you would like to come.Ó 
RiddleÕs reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the 
bed and backed away from Du
mbledore, looking furious. 
ÒYou canÕt kid me! The asylum, thatÕs where youÕre from, isnÕt it? 
ÔProfessor,Õ yes, of course Ñ well, 
IÕm not going, see? That old catÕs 
the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little 
Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and 
you can ask them, theyÕll tell 
you!Ó ÒI am not from the asylum,Ó sa
id Dumbledore patiently. ÒI am a 
teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hog-
warts. Of course, if you would ra
ther not come to the school, no-
body will force you ÑÓ 
ÒIÕd like to see them
 try,Ó sneered Riddle. 
ÒHogwarts,Ó Dumbledore went on, 
as though he had not heard 
RiddleÕs last words, Òi
s a school for people wi
th special abilities ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm not mad!Ó 
ÒI know that you are not mad. Ho
gwarts is not a school for mad 
people. It is a school of magic.Ó 
There was silence. Riddle had froz
en, his face expressionless, but 
his eyes were flickering back 
and forth between each of Dumble-
doreÕs, as though trying to
 catch one of them lying. 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +85" ÒMagic?Ó he repeat
ed in a whisper. 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒItÕs . . . itÕs magi
c, what I can do?Ó 
ÒWhat is it that you can do?Ó 
ÒAll sorts,Ó breathed Riddle. A flus
h of excitement was rising up 
his neck into his hollow cheeks; 
he looked fevered. ÒI can make 
things move without touching th
em. I can make animals do what 
I want them to do, without traini
ng them. I can make bad things 
happen to people who annoy me. I 
can make them hurt if I want 
to.Ó 
His legs were trembling. He st
umbled forward and sat down on 
the bed again, staring at his hand
s, his head bowed as though in 
prayer. ÒI knew I was different,Ó he whispered to his own quivering fin-
gers. ÒI knew I was special. Alwa
ys, I knew there was something.Ó 
ÒWell, you were quite right,Ó 
said Dumbledore, who was no 
longer smiling, but wa
tching Riddle intently. 
ÒYou are a wizard.Ó 
Riddle lifted his head. His face
 was transfigured: There was a 
wild happiness upon it, yet for so
me reason it did not make him 
better looking; on the contrary, 
his finely carved features seemed 
somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial. 
ÒAre you a wizard too?Ó 
ÒYes, I am.Ó 
ÒProve it,Ó said Riddle at once
, in the same commanding tone he 
had used when he had said, ÒTell the truth.Ó 
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. ÒIf,
 as I take it, you are accept-
ing your place at Hogwarts ÑÓ 
ÒOf course I am!Ó 
ÒThen you will address me 
as ÔProfessorÕ or Ôsir.ÕÓ 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +8+" RiddleÕs expression hardened for 
the most fleeting moment be-
fore he said, in an unrecognizably
 polite voice, ÒIÕm sorry, sir. I 
meant Ñ please, Professor, could you show me Ñ ?Ó 
Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he 
would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical 
demonstrations at Hogwarts, that th
ey were currently in a building 
full of Muggles and must therefore
 be cautious. To his great sur-
prise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket 
of his suit jacket, pointed it at 
the shabby wardrobe in the corner, 
and gave the wand a casual flick. 
The wardrobe burs
t into flames. 
Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry
 could hardly blame him for 
howling in shock and rage; all his
 worldly possessions must be in 
there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames van-
ished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged. 
Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his ex-
pression greedy, he pointed at th
e wand. ÒWhere ca
n I get one of 
them?Ó ÒAll in good time,Ó said Dumb
ledore. ÒI think there is some-
thing trying to get out of your wardrobe.Ó 
And sure enough, a faint rattling 
could be heard from inside it. 
For the first time, Ridd
le looked frightened. 
ÒOpen the door,Ó sa
id Dumbledore. 
Riddle hesitated, then crosse
d the room and threw open the 
wardrobe door. On the topmost shel
f, above a rail of threadbare 
clothes, a small cardboard box was 
shaking and rattling as though 
there were several frantic mice trapped inside it. 
ÒTake it out,Ó said Dumbledore. 
Riddle took down the quaking 
box. He looked unnerved. 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +86" ÒIs there anything in 
that box that you ought not to have?Ó asked 
Dumbledore. Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, cl
ear, calculating look. ÒYes, I 
suppose so, sir,Ó he said finally, in an expressionless voice. 
ÒOpen it,Ó said Dumbledore. 
Riddle took off the lid and tipp
ed the contents onto his bed 
without looking at them. Harry,
 who had expected something 
much more exciting, saw a mess of sm
all, everyday objects: a yo-yo, 
a silver thimble, and a tarnishe
d mouth organ among them. Once 
free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the 
thin blankets. 
ÒYou will return them to their owners with your apologies,Ó said 
Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand 
back into his jacket. ÒI shall 
know whether it has been done. An
d be warned: Thieving is not 
tolerated at Hogwarts.Ó 
Riddle did not look remotely abashe
d; he was still staring coldly 
and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At la
st he said in a colorless voice, 
ÒYes, sir.Ó 
ÒAt Hogwarts,Ó Dumbledore went on, Òwe teach you not only to 
use magic, but to control it. You have Ñ inadvertently, I am sure Ñ 
been using your powers in a way that
 is neither taught nor tolerated 
at our school. You are not the first,
 nor will you be the last, to allow 
your magic to run away with you.
 But you should know that Hog-
warts can expel students, and the Mi
nistry of Magic Ñ yes, there is 
a Ministry Ñ will punish lawbreak
ers still more severely. All new 
wizards must accept that, in enter
ing our world, they abide by our 
laws.Ó ÒYes, sir,Ó said Riddle again. 
It was impossible to tell what he
 was thinking; his face remained 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +87" quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the 
cardboard box. When he had fini
shed, he turned to Dumbledore 
and said baldly, ÒI havenÕt got any money.Ó 
ÒThat is easily remedied,Ó said
 Dumbledore, drawing a leather 
money-pouch from his pocket. ÒThere is a fund at Hogwarts for 
those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have 
to buy some of your 
spellbooks and so on
 secondhand, but ÑÓ 
ÒWhere do you buy spellbooks?Ó 
interrupted Riddle, who had 
taken the heavy mone
y bag without thanki
ng Dumbledore, and 
was now examining a fat gold Galleon. 
ÒIn Diagon Alley,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI have your list of books 
and school equipment with me. I ca
n help you find everything ÑÓ 
ÒYouÕre coming with me?Ó 
asked Riddle, looking up. 
ÒCertainly, if you ÑÓ 
ÒI donÕt need you,Ó said Riddle. ÒIÕm used to doing things for 
myself, I go round London on 
my own all the time. How do you 
get to this Diagon Alley Ñ sir?
Ó he added, catching DumbledoreÕs 
eye. 
Harry thought that Dumbledore 
would insist upon accompany-
ing Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed 
Riddle the envelope cont
aining his list of 
equipment, and after 
telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the 
orphanage, he said, ÒYou will be 
able to see it, although Muggles 
around you Ñ non-magical people, 
that is Ñ will not. Ask for 
Tom the barman Ñ easy enough to remember, as he shares your 
name ÑÓ 
Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an 
irksome fly. 
ÒYou dislike the name ÔTomÕ?Ó 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +8," ÒThere are a lot of Toms,Ó mutte
red Riddle. Then, as though he 
could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in 
spite of himself, he asked, ÒWas 
my father a wizard? He was called 
Tom Riddle too, th
eyÕve told me.Ó 
ÒIÕm afraid I donÕt know,Ó said Dumbledore, his voice gentle. 
ÒMy mother canÕt have 
been magic, or she wouldnÕt have died,Ó 
said Riddle, more to himself th
an Dumbledore. ÒIt mustÕve been 
him. So Ñ when IÕve got all my 
stuff Ñ when do I come to this 
Hogwarts?Ó 
ÒAll the details are on the second
 piece of parchment in your en-
velope,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒYou 
will leave from KingÕs Cross Sta-
tion on the first of September. Ther
e is a train ticket in there too.Ó 
Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his 
hand again. Taking it, Riddle said
, ÒI can speak to snakes. I found 
out when weÕve been to the country on trips Ñ they find me, they 
whisper to me. Is that 
normal for a wizard?Ó 
Harry could tell that he had wit
hheld mention of this strangest 
power until that moment, 
determined to impress. 
ÒIt is unusual,Ó said Dumbledore,
 after a momentÕs hesitation, 
Òbut not unheard of.Ó 
His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over RiddleÕs 
face. They stood for a moment, man an
d boy, staring at each other. 
Then the handshake 
was broken; Dumbledor
e was at the door. 
ÒGood-bye, Tom. I shall 
see you at 
Hogwarts.Ó ÒI think that will do,Ó said 
the white-haired Dumbledore at 
HarryÕs side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly 
through darkness once more, before 
landing squarely in the present-
day office. 
ÒSit down,Ó said 
Dumbledore, landing beside Harry. 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +83" Harry obeyed, his mind
 still full of what
 he had just seen. 
ÒHe believed it much quicker 
than I did Ñ I mean, when you 
told him he was a wizard,Ó said Ha
rry. ÒI didnÕt believe Hagrid at 
first, when he told me.Ó 
ÒYes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was Ñ to use 
his word Ñ Ôspecial,ÕÓ said Dumbledore. 
ÒDid you know Ñ then?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒDid I know that I had just me
t the most dangerous Dark wiz-
ard of all time?Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒNo, I had no idea that he was 
to grow up to be what he is. Ho
wever, I was certainly intrigued by 
him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, 
something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone 
and friendless, but which, already,
 I felt I ought to do for othersÕ 
sake as much as his. 
ÒHis powers, as you heard, were
 surprisingly well-developed for 
such a young wizard and Ñ most 
interestingly and ominously of 
all Ñ he had already discovered th
at he had some measure of con-
trol over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, 
they were not the random experi
ments typical of young wizards: 
He was already using magic agains
t other people, to frighten, to 
punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the 
young boy and girl he lured into a 
cave were most suggestive. . . . 
ÔI can make them hurt if I want to. . . .
ÕÓ 
ÒAnd he was a Parselmouth,Ó interjected Harry. 
ÒYes, indeed; a rare ability, 
and one supposedly connected with 
the Dark Arts, although as we kn
ow, there are Parselmouths among 
the great and the good too. In fact
, his ability to speak to serpents 
did not make me nearly as uneasy
 as his obvious instincts for cru-
elty, secrecy, and domination. 
&#'"".'!('&""()//0'"
 +88" ÒTime is making fools of us agai
n,Ó said Dumbledore, indicating 
the dark sky beyond the windows. 
ÒBut before we part, I want to 
draw your attention to certain feat
ures of the sce
ne we have just 
witnessed, for they have a great be
aring on the matters we shall be 
discussing in fu
ture meetings. 
ÒFirstly, I hope you noticed RiddleÕs reaction when I mentioned 
that another sh
ared his first name, ÔTomÕ?Ó 
Harry nodded. 
ÒThere he showed his contempt 
for anything that tied him to 
other people, anything that ma
de him ordinary. Even then, he 
wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as 
you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created 
the mask of ÔLord VoldemortÕ be
hind which he has been hidden for 
so long. 
ÒI trust that you also noticed 
that Tom Riddle was already highly 
self-sufficient, secretive, and, 
apparently, friendless? He did not 
want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He pre-
ferred to operate alone. The adul
t Voldemort is the same. You will 
hear many of his Death Eaters clai
ming that they are in his confi-
dence, that they alone are close to
 him, even understand him. They 
are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I be-
lieve that he has ever wanted one. 
ÒAnd lastly Ñ I hope you are no
t too sleepy to pay attention to 
this, Harry Ñ the young Tom Riddle 
liked to collect trophies. You 
saw the box of stolen articles 
he had hidden in 
his room. These 
were taken from victims of his bu
llying behavior, souvenirs, if you 
will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this 
magpie-like tendency, for this, partic
ularly, will be important later. 
ÒAnd now, it really
 is time for bed.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&''*"
 +8-" Harry got to his feet. As he walk
ed across the room, his eyes fell 
upon the little table on which Marv
olo GauntÕs ring had rested last 
time, but the ring wa
s no longer there. 
ÒYes, Harry?Ó said Dumbledore, 
for Harry had come to a halt. 
ÒThe ringÕs gone,Ó said Harry, 
looking around. ÒBut I thought 
you might have the mout
h organ or something.Ó 
Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his half-
moon spectacles. 
ÒVery astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth 
organ.Ó And on that enigmatic note he 
waved to Harry, who understood 
himself to be dismissed.

   arry had Herbology first thin
g the following morning. 
He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about 
his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-
heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable 
patch toward the greenhouses. The 
weekendÕs brutal wind had died 
out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little 
longer than usual to find
 the correct greenhouse. 
ÒWow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,Ó said Ron qui-
etly, as they took their places ar
ound one of the gnarled Snargaluff 
stumps that formed this termÕs project, and began pulling on their 
protective gloves. ÒBut I still 
donÕt get why DumbledoreÕs showing 
you all this. I mean, itÕs really interesting and everything, but whatÕs 
the point?Ó 
ÒDunno,Ó said Harry, inserting a gu
m shield. ÒBut he says itÕs all 
important and itÕll help me survive.Ó 
ÒI think itÕs fascinating,Ó said
 Hermione earnestly. ÒIt makes 
#"!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -45" absolute sense to know as much 
about Voldemort as possible. How 
else will you find 
out his weaknesses?Ó 
ÒSo how was SlughornÕs latest 
party?Ó Harry asked her thickly 
through the gum shield. 
ÒOh, it was quite fun, really,Ó
 said Hermione, now putting on 
protective goggles. ÒI mean, he dr
ones on about famous ex-pupils a 
bit, and he absolutely 
fawns on McLaggen because heÕs so well-
connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced 
us to Gwenog Jones.Ó 
ÒGwenog Jones?Ó said Ron, his eyes widening under his own 
goggles. Ò
The Gwenog Jones? Captain of
 the Holyhead Harpies?Ó 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Hermione. ÒP
ersonally, I thought she was a 
bit full of herself, but ÑÓ 
ÒQuite enough chat over here!Ó said Professor Sprout briskly, 
bustling over and looking stern. 
ÒYouÕre lagging behind, everybody 
else has started, and NevilleÕs
 already got hi
s first pod!Ó 
They looked around; sure enoug
h, there sat Neville with a 
bloody lip and several nasty scratche
s along the side of his face, but 
clutching an unpleasantly pulsating 
green object about the size of a 
grapefruit. 
ÒOkay, Professor, weÕre starting now!Ó said Ron, adding quietly, 
when she had turned away again, ÒshouldÕve used Muffliato, Harry.Ó 
ÒNo, we shouldnÕt!Ó said Hermione
 at once, looking, as she al-
ways did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince 
and his spells. ÒWell, come on . . 
. weÕd better get going. . . .Ó 
She gave the other two an apprehen
sive look; they all took deep 
breaths and then dived at th
e gnarled stump between them. 
It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out 
of the top and whipped through th
e air. One tangled itself in 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -46" HermioneÕs hair, and Ron beat it 
back with a pair of secateurs; 
Harry succeeded in trappi
ng a couple of vines and knotting them 
together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike 
branches; Hermione plunged her ar
m bravely into this hole, which 
closed like a trap around he
r elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and 
wrenched at the vines, forcing the 
hole to open again, and Hermi-
one snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like 
NevilleÕs. At once, the prickly vi
nes shot back 
inside, and the 
gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of 
wood. ÒYou know, I donÕt think IÕll be having any of these in my garden 
when IÕve got my own place,Ó said
 Ron, pushing his goggles up 
onto his forehead and wipi
ng sweat from his face. 
ÒPass me a bowl,Ó said Hermione,
 holding the pulsating pod at 
armÕs length; Harry handed one ov
er and she dropped the pod into 
it with a look of disgust on her face. 
ÒDonÕt be squeamish, squeeze it
 out, theyÕre best when theyÕre 
fresh!Ó called Professor Sprout. 
ÒAnyway,Ó said Hermione, contin
uing their interrupted conver-
sation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, 
ÒSlughornÕs going to have a Christ
mas party, Harry, and thereÕs no 
way youÕll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually 
asked me to check your free evenings, 
so he could be sure to have it 
on a night you can come.Ó 
Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, 
who was attempting to burst 
the pod in the bowl by putting bo
th hands on it, standing up, and 
squashing it as hard as he could, 
said angrily, ÒAnd this is another 
party just for SlughornÕs favorites, is it?Ó 
ÒJust for the Slug Club, yes,Ó said Hermione. 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -4-" The pod flew out from under RonÕs fingers and hit the green-
house glass, rebounding onto the 
back of Professor SproutÕs head 
and knocking off her old, patched 
hat. Harry went to retrieve the 
pod; when he got back, He
rmione was saying, ÒLook, 
I didnÕt make 
up the name ÔSlug ClubÕ ÑÓ 
ÒÔSlug Club,
ÕÓ repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. ÒItÕs 
pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why donÕt you try 
hooking up with McLaggen, then
 Slughorn can make you King 
and Queen Slug ÑÓ 
ÒWeÕre allowed to bring guests,Ó
 said Hermione, who for some 
reason had turned a bright, 
boiling scarlet, Òand I was 
going
 to ask 
you to come, but if you think itÕs 
that stupid then 
I wonÕt bother!Ó 
Harry suddenly wished the pod had 
flown a little farther, so that 
he need not have been
 sitting here with the pair of them. Unno-
ticed by either, he seized the bo
wl that contained the pod and be-
gan to try and open it by the nois
iest and most energetic means he 
could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of 
their conversation. 
ÒYou were going to ask me?Ó as
ked Ron, in a completely differ-
ent voice. 
ÒYes,Ó said Hermione angrily. ÒB
ut obviously if youÕd rather I 
hooked up with McLaggen 
. . .Ó 
There was a pause while Harry cont
inued to pound the resilient 
pod with a trowel. 
ÒNo, I wouldnÕt,Ó said Ron, in a very quiet voice. 
Harry missed the pod, hit 
the bowl, and shattered it. 
ÒReparo,Ó he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and 
the bowl sprang back together agai
n. The crash, however, appeared 
to have awoken Ron and Hermione
 to HarryÕs presence. Hermione 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -47" looked flustered and immediatel
y started fussing about for her 
copy of 
Flesh-Eating Trees of the World
 to find out the correct way 
to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish 
but also rather pl
eased with himself. 
ÒHand that over, Harry,Ó said He
rmione hurriedly. ÒIt says weÕre 
supposed to puncture them wi
th something sharp. . . .Ó 
Harry passed her the pod in the bo
wl; he and Ron both snapped 
their goggles back over their eyes
 and dived, once more, for the 
stump. It was not as though he was rea
lly surprised, th
ought Harry, as 
he wrestled with a thorny vine int
ent upon throttling him; he had 
had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was 
not sure how he felt about it. . . . He and Cho were now too em-
barrassed to look at each other, let 
alone talk to each other; what if 
Ron and Hermione started going 
out together, then split up? 
Could their friendship survive it
? Harry remembered the few weeks 
when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he 
had not enjoyed trying to bridge
 the distance between them. And 
then, what if they didnÕt split up? 
What if they became like Bill and 
Fleur, and it became 
excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their 
presence, so that he 
was shut out for good? 
ÒGotcha!Ó yelled Ron, pulling a se
cond pod from the stump just 
as Hermione managed to burst the 
first one open, so that the bowl 
was full of tubers wrigglin
g like pale green worms. 
The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of 
SlughornÕs party. Although Harr
y watched his two friends more 
closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem 
any different except that they were 
a little politer to each other than 
usual. Harry supposed he would ju
st have to wait to see what 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -48" happened under the influence of bu
tterbeer in SlughornÕs dimly lit 
room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had 
more pressing worries. 
Katie Bell was still in St. MungoÕs 
Hospital with no prospect of 
leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry 
had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser 
short. He kept putting off replac
ing Katie in the hope that she 
would return, but their opening ma
tch against Slytherin was loom-
ing, and he finally had to accept th
at she would not be back in time 
to play. 
Harry did not think he could st
and another full-House tryout. 
With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cor-
nered Dean Thomas after Transfig
uration one day. Most of the 
class had already left, although se
veral twittering yellow birds were 
still zooming around the room, all of HermioneÕs creation; nobody 
else had succeeded in conjuring so 
much as a feather from thin air. 
ÒAre you still interested
 in playing Chaser?Ó 
ÒWha Ñ ? Yeah, of course!Ó said Dean excitedly. Over DeanÕs 
shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan
 slamming his books into his 
bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have pre-
ferred not to have to ask Dean to
 play was that he knew Seamus 
would not like it. On the other ha
nd, he had to do what was best 
for the team, and Dean
 had outflown Seamus
 at the tryouts. 
ÒWell then, youÕre in,Ó said Harry. ÒThereÕs a practice tonight, 
seven oÕclock.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Dean. ÒCheers, Harr
y! Blimey, I canÕt wait to tell 
Ginny!Ó He sprinted out of the room, 
leaving Harry and Seamus alone 
together, an uncomfortable moment
 made no easier when a bird 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -49" dropping landed on SeamusÕs head
 as one of HermioneÕs canaries 
whizzed over them. 
Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of 
KatieÕs substitute. There was much muttering in the common 
room about the fact that Harry 
had now chosen two of his class-
mates for the team. As Harry had 
endured much worse mutterings 
than this in his school career, 
he was not particularly bothered, 
but all the same, the pressure was 
increasing to provide a win in 
the upcoming match against Slythe
rin. If Gryffindor won, Harry 
knew that the whole House would fo
rget that they had criticized 
him and swear that they had always
 known it was a great team. If 
they lost . . . well, Harry thought 
wryly, he had still endured worse 
mutterings. . . . 
Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly 
that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beat-
ers, Peakes and Coote, were getti
ng better all the time. The only 
problem was Ron. 
Harry had known all along that Ro
n was an inconsistent player 
who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortu-
nately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season 
seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in 
half a dozen goals, most of them
 scored by Ginny, his technique 
became wilder and wilder, until 
he finally punched an oncoming 
Demelza Robins in the mouth. 
ÒIt was an accident, IÕm sorry,
 Demelza, really sorry!Ó Ron 
shouted after her as she zigzagge
d back to the ground, dripping 
blood everywhere. 
ÒI just ÑÓ 
ÒPanicked,Ó Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and ex-
amining her fat lip. ÒY
ou prat, Ron, look at
 the state of her!Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -4:" ÒI can fix that,Ó said 
Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing 
his wand at DemelzaÕs 
mouth, and saying Ò
Episkey.Ó ÒAnd Ginny, 
donÕt call Ron a prat, youÕre no
t the Captain of this team ÑÓ 
ÒWell, you seemed too busy to 
call him a prat and I thought 
someone should ÑÓ 
Harry forced himself not to laugh. 
ÒIn the air, everyone
, letÕs go. . . .Ó 
Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, 
though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when 
they were this cl
ose to the match. 
ÒGood work, everyone, I think weÕl
l flatten Slytherin,Ó he said 
bracingly and the Chasers and Be
aters left the changing room 
looking reasonably happy with themselves. 
ÒI played like a sack of dragon dung,Ó said Ron in a hollow voice 
when the door had swun
g shut behind Ginny. 
ÒNo, you didnÕt,Ó said Harry fi
rmly. ÒYouÕre the best Keeper I 
tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.Ó 
He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back 
to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron 
was looking marginally more ch
eerful. When Harry pushed open 
the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, 
however, they found themselves 
looking at Dean and Ginny, who 
were locked in a close embrace and 
kissing fiercely as though glued 
together. 
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in 
HarryÕs stomach, clawing at his in
sides: Hot blood seemed to flood 
his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage 
urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, 
he heard RonÕs voice as though from a great distance away. 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -4." ÒOi!Ó Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. 
ÒWhat?Ó said Ginny. 
ÒI donÕt want to find my own sist
er snogging people in public!Ó 
ÒThis was a deserted corridor ti
ll you came butting in!Ó said 
Ginny. Dean was looking embarrassed. He 
gave Harry a shifty grin that 
Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roar-
ing for DeanÕs instant dismissal from the team. 
ÒEr . . . cÕmon, Ginny,Ó said Dean, ÒletÕs go back to the common 
room. . . .Ó 
ÒYou go!Ó said Ginny. ÒI want 
a word with my dear brother!Ó 
Dean left, looking as though 
he was not sorry to depart the 
scene. ÒRight,Ó said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and 
glaring at Ron, ÒletÕs get this straig
ht once and for all. It is none of 
your business who I go out with or
 what I do with them, Ron ÑÓ 
ÒYeah, it is!Ó said Ron, just as angrily. ÒDÕyou think I want peo-
ple saying my sisterÕs a ÑÓ 
ÒA what?Ó shouted Ginny,
 drawing her wand. ÒA 
what, exactly?Ó 
ÒHe doesnÕt mean anything, Gi
nny ÑÓ said Harry automati-
cally, though the monster was roarin
g its approval of RonÕs words. 
ÒOh yes he does!Ó she said, flar
ing up at Harry. ÒJust because 
heÕs
 never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss 
heÕs
 ever 
had is from our Auntie Muriel ÑÓ 
ÒShut your mouth!Ó bellowed Ro
n, bypassing red and turning 
maroon. 
ÒNo, I will not!Ó yelled Ginny, besi
de herself. ÒIÕve seen you with 
Phlegm, hoping sheÕll kiss you on th
e cheek every time you see her, 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -44" itÕs pathetic! If you went out an
d got a bit of sn
ogging done your-
self, you wouldnÕt mind so much 
that everyone else does it!Ó 
Ron had pulled out his wand t
oo; Harry stepped swiftly between 
them. ÒYou donÕt know what youÕre ta
lking about!Ó Ron roared, trying 
to get a clear shot at Ginny arou
nd Harry, who was now standing 
in front of her with his arms outs
tretched. ÒJust because I donÕt do 
it in public Ñ !Ó 
Ginny screamed with derisive la
ughter, trying to push Harry out 
of the way. 
ÒBeen kissing Pigwidgeon, have yo
u? Or have you got a picture 
of Auntie Muriel stashe
d under your pillow?Ó 
ÒYouÑÓ 
A streak of orange light flew 
under HarryÕs left arm and missed 
Ginny by inches; Harry pushed
 Ron up against the wall. 
ÒDonÕt be stupid ÑÓ 
ÒHarryÕs snogged Cho Chang!Ó 
shouted Ginny, who sounded 
close to tears now. ÒAnd Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, itÕs only 
you who acts like itÕs something disgusting, Ron, and thatÕs because 
youÕve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!Ó 
And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; 
the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breath-
ing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filc
hÕs cat, appeared around the cor-
ner, which broke the tension. 
ÒCÕmon,Ó said Harry, as the sound of FilchÕs shuffling feet 
reached their ears. 
They hurried up the stairs an
d along a seventh-floor corridor. 
ÒOi, out of the way!Ó Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in 
fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn. 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -4/" Harry hardly noticed the sound of 
shattering glass; he felt dis-
oriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something 
like this. 
ItÕs just because sheÕs RonÕs sister, 
he told himself. 
You just 
didnÕt like seeing her kissing Dean because sheÕs RonÕs sister.
 . . . 
But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same de-
serted corridor with 
himself kissing Ginny in
stead. . . . The mon-
ster in his chest purred . . . bu
t then he saw Ron 
ripping open the 
tapestry curtain and drawing his wa
nd on Harry, shouting things 
like Òbetrayal of trustÓ . . . Òsupposed to be my friendÓ . . . 
ÒDÕyou think Hermione did snog
 Krum?Ó Ron asked abruptly, 
as they approached the Fat Lady
. Harry gave a guilty start and 
wrenched his imagination away fr
om a corridor in which no Ron 
intruded, in which he and 
Ginny were quite alone Ñ 
ÒWhat?Ó he said confused
ly. ÒOh . . . er . . .Ó 
The honest answer was Òyes,Ó bu
t he did not want to give it. 
However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on HarryÕs 
face. ÒDilligrout,Ó he said darkly to
 the Fat Lady, and they climbed 
through the portrait hole
 into the common room. 
Neither of them mentioned Ginn
y or Hermione again; indeed, 
they barely spoke to each other th
at evening and got into bed in si-
lence, each absorbed 
in his own thoughts. 
Harry lay awake for a long time, l
ooking up at the canopy of his 
four-poster and trying to convince
 himself that his feelings for 
Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly.
 They had lived, had they not, 
like brother and sister all summer,
 playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, 
and having a laugh about Bill an
d Phlegm? He had known Ginny 
for years now. . . . It was natural th
at he should feel protective . . . 
natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -/5" Dean limb from limb for kissing her . . . No . . . he would have to 
control that particular 
brotherly feeling. . . . 
Ron gave a great grunting snore. 
SheÕs RonÕs sister,
 Harry told himself firmly. 
RonÕs sister. SheÕs out-of-
bounds. He would not risk his friend
ship with Ron for anything. 
He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited 
for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to 
stray anywhere near Ginny. 
Harry awoke next morning feeling
 slightly dazed and confused 
by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a BeaterÕs 
bat, but by midday he would ha
ve happily exchanged the dream 
Ron for the real one, who was no
t only cold-sho
uldering Ginny 
and Dean, but also treating a hu
rt and bewildered Hermione with 
an icy, sneering indifference. What
 was more, Ron seemed to have 
become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average 
Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent th
e day attempting to keep the 
peace between Ron and Hermione with
 no success; finally, Hermi-
one departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the 
boysÕ dormitory after swearing angr
ily at several frightened first 
years for look
ing at him. 
To HarryÕs dismay, RonÕs new aggression did not wear off over the 
next few days. Worse still, it coinci
ded with an even deeper dip in his 
Keeping skills, which made him still 
more aggressive, so that during 
the final Quidditch practice before 
SaturdayÕs match, he failed to 
save every single goal the Chaser
s aimed at him, but bellowed at 
everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears. 
ÒYou shut up and leave her alo
ne!Ó shouted Peakes, who was about 
two-thirds RonÕs height, though 
admittedly carrying a heavy bat. 
 )'012"")'01!13"
 -/6" ÒENOUGH!Ó bellowed Harry, wh
o had seen Gi
nny glowering 
in RonÕs direction and, remember
ing her reputation as an accom-
plished caster of the Bat-Bogey He
x, soared over to intervene be-
fore things got out of hand. ÒPeake
s, go and pack up the Bludgers. 
Demelza, pull yourself together, 
you played really well today. 
Ron . . .Ó he waited until the rest
 of the team were out of earshot 
before saying it, ÒyouÕr
e my best mate, but carry on treating the rest 
of them like this and IÕm goin
g to kick you off the team.Ó 
He really thought for a moment 
that Ron might hit him, but then 
something much worse happened: Ro
n seemed to sag on his broom; 
all the fight went out of him and he
 said, ÒI resign. IÕm pathetic.Ó 
ÒYouÕre not pathetic and youÕre
 not resigning!Ó said Harry 
fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. ÒYou can save any-
thing when youÕre on form, itÕs
 a mental problem youÕve got!Ó 
ÒYou calling me mental?Ó 
ÒYeah, maybe I am!Ó 
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his 
head wearily. ÒI know you havenÕ
t got any time to find another 
Keeper, so IÕll play tomorrow, but 
if we lose, and we will, IÕm tak-
ing myself off the team.Ó 
Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting 
RonÕs confidence all through dinn
er, but Ron was too busy being 
grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in 
the common room that evening, 
but his assertion that the whole 
team would be devastated if Ro
n left was somewhat undermined 
by the fact that the rest of the 
team was sitting in a huddle in a 
distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him 
nasty looks. Finally Harry tried ge
tting angry again 
in the hope  
 !#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -/-" of provoking Ron into a defian
t, and hopefully goal-saving, 
attitude, but this strategy did no
t appear to work any better than 
encouragement; Ron went to bed 
as dejected and hopeless as 
ever. Harry lay awake for a very long time
 in the darkness. He did not 
want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Cap-
tain, but he was determined to 
beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch 
even if he could not yet prove his 
suspicions about him. Yet if Ron 
played as he had done in the last
 few practices, their chances of 
winning were ve
ry slim. . . . 
If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull him-
self together . . . make him play 
at the top of his form . . . some-
thing that would ensure
 that Ron had a rea
lly good day. . . . 
And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of 
inspiration. 
Breakfast was the usual excita
ble affair next morning; the 
Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffin-
dor team entered the Great Hall. 
Harry glanced at the ceiling and 
saw a clear, pale bl
ue sky: a good omen. The Gryffindor table, a solid ma
ss of red and gold, cheered as 
Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron gri-
maced weakly and 
shook his head. 
ÒCheer up, Ron!Ó called Lavender. 
ÒI know youÕll be brilliant!Ó 
Ron ignored her. 
ÒTea?Ó Harry asked him. ÒCoffee? Pumpkin juice?Ó 
ÒAnything,Ó said Ron glumly, ta
king a moody bite of toast. 
A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of 
RonÕs recent unpleasant behavior
 that she had not come down to 
breakfast with them, paused 
on her way up the table. 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -/7" ÒHow are you both feeling?Ó she 
asked tentatively, her eyes on 
the back of RonÕs head. 
ÒFine,Ó said Harry, who was co
ncentrating on 
handing Ron a 
glass of pumpkin juice. ÒThe
re you go, Ron. Drink up.Ó 
Ron had just raised the glass to
 his lips when Hermione spoke 
sharply. ÒDonÕt drink that, Ron!Ó 
Both Harry and Ron lo
oked up at her. 
ÒWhy not?Ó said Ron. 
Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not be-
lieve her eyes. 
ÒYou just put something in that drink.Ó 
ÒExcuse me?Ó said Harry. 
ÒYou heard me. I saw you. You ju
st tipped something into RonÕs 
drink. YouÕve got the bottle
 in your hand right now!Ó 
ÒI donÕt know what youÕre talk
ing about,Ó said Harry, stowing 
the little bottle ha
stily in his pocket. 
ÒRon, I warn you, don
Õt drink it!Ó Herm
ione said again, 
alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and 
said, ÒStop bossing me around, Hermione.Ó 
She looked scandalized. Bending 
low so that only Harry could 
hear her, she hissed, ÒYou should 
be expelled for that. IÕd never have 
believed it of you, Harry!Ó 
ÒHark whoÕs talking,Ó he whis
pered back. ÒConfunded anyone 
lately?Ó She stormed up the table away 
from them. Harry watched her go 
without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a 
serious business Quidditch was. He
 then looked around at Ron, 
who was smacking his lips. 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -/8" ÒNearly time,Ó said
 Harry blithely. 
The frosty grass crunched underf
oot as they strode down to the 
stadium. 
ÒPretty lucky the weat
herÕs this good, eh?Ó
 Harry asked Ron. 
ÒYeah,Ó said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking. 
Ginny and Demelza were already 
wearing their Quidditch robes 
and waiting in the changing room. 
ÒConditions look ideal,Ó said Gi
nny, ignoring Ron. ÒAnd guess 
what? That Slytherin Chaser Vais
ey Ñ he took a Bludger in the 
head yesterday during their practice
, and heÕs too sore to play! And 
even better than that Ñ Ma
lfoyÕs gone o
ff sick too!Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. ÒHeÕs ill? 
WhatÕs wrong with him?Ó 
ÒNo idea, but itÕs great for us,Ó
 said Ginny brightly. ÒTheyÕre 
playing Harper instead; heÕs in my year and heÕs an idiot.Ó 
Harry smiled back vaguely, but as 
he pulled on his scarlet robes 
his mind was far from Quidditch. 
Malfoy had once before claimed 
he could not play due to
 injury, but on that 
occasion he had made 
sure the whole match was reschedu
led for a time that suited the 
Slytherins better. Why was he now 
happy to let a substitute go on? 
Was he really ill, 
or was he faking? 
ÒFishy, isnÕt it?Ó he said in an undertone to Ron. ÒMalfoy not 
playing?Ó ÒLucky, I call it,Ó said Ron, looking slightly more animated. 
ÒAnd Vaisey off too, heÕs their be
st goal scorer, I didnÕt fancy Ñ 
hey!Ó he said suddenly, freezing 
halfway through pulling on his 
KeeperÕs gloves and 
staring at Harry. 
ÒWhat?Ó 
 )'012"")'01!13"
 -/9" ÒI . . . you . . .Ó Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both 
scared and excited. ÒMy drink . 
. . my pumpkin juice . . . you 
didnÕt . . . ?Ó 
Harry raised his eyebrows, but sa
id nothing except, ÒWeÕll be 
starting in about five minutes, 
youÕd better get 
your boots on.Ó 
They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. 
One end of the stadium was solid re
d and gold; the other, a sea of 
green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs 
and Ravenclaws had taken sides 
too: Amidst all the yelling and cl
apping Harry could distinctly hear 
the roar of Luna 
LovegoodÕs famous lion-topped hat. 
Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was stand-
ing ready to release the 
balls from the crate. 
ÒCaptains shake hands,Ó she 
said, and Harry had his hand 
crushed by the new Slytherin Ca
ptain, Urquhart. ÒMount your 
brooms. On the whistle . . . th
ree . . . two . . . one . . .Ó The whistle sounded, Harry and the 
others kicked off hard from 
the frozen ground, an
d they were away. 
Harry soared around the perime
ter of the grounds, looking 
around for the Snitch and keep
ing one eye on Harper, who was 
zigzagging far below him. Then a 
voice that was jarringly different 
to the usual commen
tatorÕs started up. 
ÒWell, there they go, and I think weÕre all surprised to see the 
team that PotterÕs put together this year. Many thought, given 
Ronald WeasleyÕs patchy performanc
e as Keeper last year, that he 
might be off the team, but of cour
se, a close personal friendship 
with the Captain does help. . . .Ó 
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the 
Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to  
 !#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -/:" look toward the commentatorÕs p
odium. A tall, skinny blond boy 
with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical 
megaphone that had once been 
Lee JordanÕs; Harry recognized 
Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff play
er whom he heartily disliked. 
ÒOh, and here comes SlytherinÕ
s first attempt on goal, itÕs 
Urquhart streaking do
wn the pitch and ÑÓ 
HarryÕs stomach 
turned over. 
ÒÑ Weasley saves it, well, heÕs bound to get lucky sometimes, I 
suppose. . . .Ó 
ÒThatÕs right, Smith, he is,Ó mu
ttered Harry, grinning to him-
self, as he dived amongst the Chas
ers with his eyes searching all 
around for some hint of the elusive Snitch. 
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading 
sixty points to zero, Ron having ma
de some truly spectacular saves, 
some by the very tips of his gloves
, and Ginny having scored four of 
GryffindorÕs six goals. This ef
fectively stopped Zacharias won-
dering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because 
Harry liked them, and 
he started on Peakes
 and Coote instead. 
ÒOf course, Coote isnÕt really the 
usual build for a 
Beater,Ó said 
Zacharias loftily, ÒtheyÕve gene
rally got a bit more muscle ÑÓ 
ÒHit a Bludger at him!Ó Harry 
called to Coote as he zoomed 
past, but Coote, grinni
ng broadly, chose to 
aim the next Bludger at 
Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direc-
tion. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the 
Bludger had found its mark. 
It seemed as though Gryffindor
 could do no wrong. Again and 
again they scored, and again and 
again, at the other end of the 
pitch, Ron saved goals with appare
nt ease. He was actually smiling 
now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a 
)'012"")'01!13"
 -/." rousing chorus of the old favorite ÒWeasley Is Our King,Ó he pre-
tended to conduct them from on high. 
ÒThinks heÕs something special t
oday, doesnÕt he?Ó said a snide 
voice, and Harry was nearly knocke
d off his broom as Harper col-
lided with him hard an
d deliberately. ÒYour bl
ood-traitor pal . . .Ó 
Madam HoochÕs back was turned
, and though Gryffindors be-
low shouted in anger, by the time
 she looked around, Harper had 
already sped off. His shoulder 
aching, Harry raced after him, de-
termined to ram him back. . . . 
ÒAnd I think Harper of Slythe
rinÕs seen the Snitch!Ó said 
Zacharias Smith through his megaph
one. ÒYes, heÕs certainly seen 
something Potter hasnÕt!Ó 
Smith really was an idiot, though
t Harry, hadnÕt he noticed them 
collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the 
sky Ñ Smith was right and Harry wa
s wrong: Harper had not sped 
upward at random; he 
had spotted what Harry 
had not: The Snitch 
was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the 
clear blue sky. 
Harry accelerated; the wind was whis
tling in his ears so that it 
drowned all sound of SmithÕs commentary or the crowd, but 
Harper was still ahead of him, an
d Gryffindor was only a hundred 
points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now 
Harper was feet from it, hi
s hand outstretched. . . . 
ÒOi, Harper!Ó yelled Harry in 
desperation. ÒHow much did 
Malfoy pay you to come
 on instead of him?Ó 
He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a dou-
ble-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let 
it slip through his fingers, and 
shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering 
ball and caught it. 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 -/4" ÒYES!Ó Harry yelled. Wheeling ar
ound, he hurtled back toward 
the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized 
what had happened, a 
great shout went up that almost drowned 
the sound of the whistle that 
signaled the end of the game. 
ÒGinny, whereÕre you going?Ó 
yelled Harry, who had found him-
self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the 
team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty 
crash, she collided with the comm
entatorÕs podium. As the crowd 
shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the 
wreckage of wood under which Za
charias was feeb
ly stirring; 
Harry heard Ginny saying blithely 
to an irate Professor McGona-
gall, ÒForgot to brak
e, Professor, sorry.Ó 
Laughing, Harry broke free of the 
rest of the team and hugged 
Ginny, but let go very quickly. 
Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a 
cheering Ron on the back instead 
as, all enmity forgotten, the 
Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and 
waving to their supporters. 
The atmosphere in the chan
ging room was jubilant. 
ÒParty up in the common room, Seamus said!Ó yelled Dean exu-
berantly. ÒCÕmon, Ginny, Demelza!Ó 
Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They 
were just about to leave when He
rmione entered. She was twisting 
her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. 
ÒI want a word with you, Harry.
Ó She took a deep breath. ÒYou 
shouldnÕt have done it. You he
ard Slughorn, itÕs illegal.Ó 
ÒWhat are you going to do, tu
rn us in?Ó demanded Ron. 
ÒWhat are you two talking about?
Ó asked Harry, turning away to 
hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning. 
ÒYou know perfectly well what weÕre talking about!Ó said Hermi-
)'012"")'01!13"
 -//" one shrilly. ÒYou spiked RonÕs juice with lucky potion at breakfast! 
Felix Felicis!Ó 
ÒNo, I didnÕt,Ó said Harry, turn
ing back to face them both. 
ÒYes you did, Harry, and thatÕs wh
y everything went right, there 
were Slytherin play
ers missing and Ron saved everything!Ó 
ÒI didnÕt put it in!Ó said Harry, 
grinning broadly. He slipped his 
hand inside his jacket pocket an
d drew out the tiny bottle that 
Hermione had seen in his hand that
 morning. It was full of golden 
potion and the cork was still tigh
tly sealed with wax. ÒI wanted 
Ron to think IÕd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were look-
ing.Ó He looked at Ron. ÒYou saved everything because you felt 
lucky. You did it all yourself.Ó 
He pocketed the potion again. 
ÒThere really wasnÕt anything 
in my pumpkin ju

astounded. ÒBut the weatherÕs good 
. . . and Vaisey couldnÕt play. 
. . . I honestly havenÕt be
en given lucky potion?Ó 
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then 
rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. Ò
You added Felix Felicis 
to RonÕs juice this morning, thatÕs why he saved everything
! See! I can 
save goals without help, Hermione!Ó 
ÒI never said you couldnÕt Ñ Ron, 
you thought youÕd been given 
it too!Ó 
But Ron had already strode past
 her out of the door with his 
broomstick over
 his shoulder. 
ÒEr,Ó said Harry into the sudden si
lence; he had not expected his 
plan to backfire like 
this, Òshall . . . shall we go up to the party, 
then?Ó ÒYou go!Ó said Hermione, blinking back tears. ÒIÕm 
sick of Ron 
at the moment, I donÕt know what IÕm supposed to have done. . . .Ó

 755" And she stormed out of the changing room too. 
Harry walked slowly back up th
e grounds toward the castle 
through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at 
him, but he felt a great sense of le
tdown; he had been sure that if 
Ron won the match, he and Herm
ione would be friends again im-
mediately. He did not see how he
 could possibly explain to Hermi-
one that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, 
not when the offense had occurred so long ago. 
Harry could not see Hermione at
 the Gryffindor celebration 
party, which was in full swing wh
en he arrived. Renewed cheers 
and clapping greeted his appearan
ce, and he was soon surrounded 
by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake 
off the Creevey brothers, who 
wanted a blow-by-blow match 
analysis, and the large group of girl
s that encircled him, laughing at 
his least amusing comments and batti
ng their eyelids, it was some 
time before he could try and find 
Ron. At last, he extricated him-
self from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would 
like to go to SlughornÕs Christma
s party with him. As he was duck-
ing toward the drinks table, he wa
lked straight into Ginny, Arnold 
the Pygmy Puff riding on her sh
oulder and Crookshanks mewing 
hopefully at her heels. 
ÒLooking for Ron?Ó she asked, smirking. ÒHeÕs over there, the 
filthy hypocrite.Ó 
Harry looked into the corner she 
was indicating. There, in full 
view of the whole room, stood Ro
n wrapped so closely around 
Lavender Brown it wa
s hard to tell whos
e hands were whose. 
ÒIt looks like heÕs eating her face
, doesnÕt it?Ó said Ginny dispas-
sionately. ÒBut I suppose heÕs go
t to refine his technique somehow. 
Good game, Harry.Ó 
)'012"")'01!13"
 756" She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his 
stomach, but then she wa
lked off to help hers
elf to more butterbeer. 
Crookshanks trotted afte
r her, his yellow eyes
 fixed upon Arnold. 
Harry turned away from Ron, wh
o did not look like he would 
be surfacing soon, just as the portra
it hole was closing. With a sink-
ing feeling, he thought he saw 
a mane of bushy brown hair whip-
ping out of sight. 
He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and 
pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside 
seemed to be deserted. 
ÒHermione?Ó He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was 
sitting on the teacherÕs desk, alone except for a small ring of twit-
tering yellow birds circling her 
head, which she had clearly just 
conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-
work at a time like this. ÒOh, hello, Harry,Ó she sa
id in a brittle voice. ÒI was just prac-
ticing.Ó 
ÒYeah . . . theyÕre Ñ er Ñ real
ly good. . . .Ó said Harry. 
He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering 
whether there was any chance that
 she had not noticed Ron, that 
she had merely left the room be
cause the party was a little too 
rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, ÒRon 
seems to be enjoying
 the celebrations.Ó 
ÒEr . . . does he?Ó said Harry. 
ÒDonÕt pretend you didnÕt see hi
m,Ó said Hermione. ÒHe wasnÕt 
exactly hiding it, was Ñ ?Ó 
The door behind them burst open. To HarryÕs horror, Ron came 
in, laughing, pulling La
vender by the hand. 
!#$%&'("")*+(&'',"
 75-" ÒOh,Ó he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and 
Hermione. 
ÒOops!Ó said Lavender, and she 
backed out of the room, gig-
gling. The door swung 
shut behind her. 
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was 
staring at Ron, who refused to look
 at her, but said with an odd 
mixture of bravado and awkwardn
ess, ÒHi, Harry! Wondered 
where youÕd got to!Ó 
Hermione slid off the desk. The 
little flock of golden birds con-
tinued to twitter in circles around 
her head so that she looked like 
a strange, feathery mode
l of the solar system. 
ÒYou shouldnÕt leave Lavender wait
ing outside,Ó she said quietly. 
ÒSheÕll wonder where youÕve gone.Ó 
She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry 
glanced at Ron, who wa
s looking relieved th
at nothing worse had 
happened. ÒOppugno!Ó came a shriek 
from the doorway. 
Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, 
her expression wild: The little floc
k of birds was speeding like a hail 
of fat golden bullets toward Ron,
 who yelped and covered his face 
with his hands, but 
the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at 
every bit of flesh they could reach. 
ÒGerremoffme!Ó he yell
ed, but with one last 
look of vindictive 
fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through 
it. Harry thought he heard 
a sob before it slammed.

   now was swirling against the ic
y windows once more; Christ-
mas was approaching fast. Hagrid
 had already single-handedly 
delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; gar-
lands of holly and tinsel had been
 twisted around the banisters of 
the stairs; everlasting candles glow
ed from inside the helmets of 
suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at in-
tervals along the corridors. Large grou
ps of girls tended to converge 
underneath the mistle
toe bunches every time
 Harry went past, 
which caused blockages in the co
rridors; fortunately, however, 
HarryÕs frequent nighttime wanderin
gs had given him an unusually 
good knowledge of the castleÕs secr
et passageways, so that he was 
able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes 
between classes. 
Ron, who might once have found 
the necessity of
 these detours 
a cause for jealousy rather than hil
arity, simply roared with laugh-
ter about it all. Although Harry mu
ch preferred this new laughing,

 ,-6" joking Ron to the moody, aggres
sive model he had been enduring 
for the last few weeks, the improv
ed Ron came at a heavy price. 
Firstly, Harry had to put up with
 the frequent pr
esence of Laven-
der Brown, who seemed to regard
 any moment that she was not 
kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found him-
self once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely 
ever to speak to 
each other again. 
Ron, whose hands and forearms 
still bore scratches and cuts 
from HermioneÕs bird attack, was 
taking a defensive and resentful 
tone. 
ÒShe canÕt complain,Ó he told
 Harry. ÒShe snogged Krum. So 
sheÕs found out someone wants to 
snog me too. Well, itÕs a free 
country. I havenÕt done anything wrong.Ó 
Harry did not answer, but pretended 
to be absorbed in the book 
they were supposed to have re
ad before Charms next morning 
(Quintessence
: A Quest
). Determined as he was to remain friends 
with both Ron and Hermione, he 
was spending a lot of time with 
his mouth shut tight. 
ÒI never promised Hermione anything,Ó Ron mumbled. ÒI 
mean, all right, I was going to go
 to SlughornÕs Christmas party 
with her, but she never said . . . 
just as friends . . . IÕm a free 
agent. . . .Ó 
Harry turned a page of 
Quintessence, aware that Ron was watch-
ing him. RonÕs voice tailed away in 
mutters, barely audible over the 
loud crackling of the fire, thou
gh Harry thought he caught the 
words ÒKrumÓ and Òcan
Õt complainÓ again. 
HermioneÕs schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to 
her properly in the evenings, when 
Ron was, in any case, so tightly  
 &#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,-7" wrapped around Lavender that he
 did not notice what Harry was 
doing. Hermione refused to sit 
in the common room while Ron 
was there, so Harry generally joined
 her in the library, which meant 
that their conversations 
were held in whispers. 
ÒHeÕs at perfect liberty to kiss 
whomever he likes,Ó said Hermi-
one, while the librarian, Madam 
Pince, prowled the shelves behind 
them. ÒI really couldnÕt care less.Ó 
She raised her quill and dotted an 
i so ferociously that she punc-
tured a hole in her parchment. Ha
rry said nothing. He thought his 
voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower 
over Advanced Potion-Making
 and continued to make notes on 
Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally 
pausing to decipher the PrinceÕs 
useful additions to Libatius BorageÕs text. 
ÒAnd incidentally,Ó said Hermio
ne, after a few moments, Òyou 
need to be careful.Ó 
ÒFor the last time,Ó said Harry, 
speaking in a slightly hoarse 
whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, ÒI am not giving 
back this book, IÕve learned more
 from the Half-Blood Prince than 
Snape or Slughorn have
 taught me in ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm not talking about your stup
id so-called Prince,Ó said Her-
mione, giving his book a nasty look
 as though it had been rude to 
her. ÒIÕm talking about earlier. I w
ent into the girlsÕ bathroom just 
before I came in here and there 
were about a dozen girls in there, 
including that Romilda Vane, trying
 to decide how to slip you a 
love potion. TheyÕre all hoping th
eyÕre going to get you to take 
them to SlughornÕs party, and they all seem to have bought Fred 
and GeorgeÕs love potions, which IÕm afraid to say probably 
work ÑÓ 
 !#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,-8" ÒWhy didnÕt you confiscate th
em then?Ó demanded Harry. It 
seemed extraordinary that Herm
ioneÕs mania for upholding rules 
could have abandoned her at
 this crucial juncture. 
ÒThey didnÕt have the 
potions with them in 
the bathroom,Ó said 
Hermione scornfully. ÒThey were just
 discussing tactics. As I doubt 
whether even the 
Half-Blood Prince
Ó Ñ she gave th
e book another 
nasty look Ñ Òcould dream up 
an antidote for a dozen different 
love potions at once, IÕd just invite someone to go with you, thatÕll 
stop all the others thinking theyÕv
e still got a chan
ce. ItÕs tomorrow 
night, theyÕre getting desperate.Ó 
ÒThere isnÕt anyone I want to 
invite,Ó mumbled Harry, who was 
still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, 
despite the fact that sh
e kept cropping up in his dreams in ways 
that made him devoutly thankf
ul that Ron could not perform 
Legilimency. 
ÒWell, just be careful what 
you drink, because Romilda Vane 
looked like she meant busine
ss,Ó said Hermione grimly. 
She hitched up the long roll of
 parchment on which she was 
writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with 
her quill. Harry watc
hed her with his mind a long way away. 
ÒHang on a moment,Ó he said 
slowly. ÒI thought Filch had 
banned anything bought at WeasleysÕ Wizard Wheezes?Ó 
ÒAnd when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has 
banned?Ó asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay. 
ÒBut I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come 
these girls are able to bring 
love potions into school?Ó 
ÒFred and George send them di
sguised as perfumes and cough 
potions,Ó said Hermione. ÒItÕs part of their Owl Order Service.Ó 
ÒYou know a lot about it.Ó 
&#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,-9" Hermione gave him the kind of na
sty look she had just given his 
copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 ÒIt was all on the back of the bo
ttles they showed Ginny and me 
in the summer,Ó she said coldly. ÒI donÕt go around putting potions 
in peopleÕs drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as 
bad. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, well, never mind that,Ó said Harry quickly. ÒThe point is, 
Filch is being fooled, isnÕt he? These girls are getting stuff into the 
school disguised as something else
! So why couldnÕt Malfoy have 
brought the necklace into the school Ñ ?Ó 
ÒOh, Harry . . . not 
that again . . .Ó 
ÒCome on, why not?Ó demanded Harry. 
ÒLook,Ó sighed Hermione, ÒSecrecy
 Sensors detect jinxes, curses, 
and concealment charms, donÕt they? TheyÕre used to find Dark 
Magic and Dark objects. TheyÕd have picked up a powerful curse, 
like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something thatÕs 
just been put in the wrong bottle
 wouldnÕt regist

love potions arenÕt Dark or dangerous ÑÓ 
ÒEasy for you to say,Ó muttered
 Harry, thinking of Romilda 
Vane. ÒÑ so it would be down to Filch

tion, and heÕs not a very good wiza
rd, I doubt he can tell one po-
tion from ÑÓ 
Hermione stopped dead; Harry had 
heard it too. Somebody had 
moved close behind them among 
the dark bookshelves. They 
waited, and a moment later the vu
lturelike countenance of Madam 
Pince appeared around the corner, 
her sunken cheeks
, her skin like 
parchment, and her long hooked 
nose illuminated unflatteringly 
by the lamp she was carrying.

copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 off the table as 
she lunged at it 
with a clawlike hand. 
ÒDespoiled!Ó she hissed. ÒDesecrated! Befouled!Ó 
ÒItÕs just a book thatÕs been wr

out of her grip. 
She looked as though she might 
have a seizure; Hermione, who 
had hastily packed her things, gr
abbed Harry by the arm and frog-
marched him away. 
ÒSheÕll ban you from the library 
if youÕre not careful. Why did

ÒItÕs not my fault sheÕs barking

made their way along the deserted

common room, arguing about whet
her or not Filch and Madam 
Pince were secretly in 
love with each other. 
ÒBaubles,Ó said Harry to the Fat 
Lady, this being the new, festive 
password. 
ÒSame to you,Ó said the Fat Lady
 with a roguish grin, and she 
swung forward to admit them. 
ÒHi, Harry!Ó said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed 
through the portrait hole

 &#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,-;" Hermione gave him a Òwhat-did-
I-tell-you?Ó look over her 
shoulder. 
ÒNo thanks,Ó said Harry quickl
y. ÒI donÕt like it much.Ó 
ÒWell, take these anyway,Ó said 
Romilda, thrusting a box into his 
hands. ÒChocolate Cauldrons, they
Õve got firewhisky in them. My

but I donÕt like them.Ó 
ÒOh Ñ right Ñ thanks a lot,Ó sa
id Harry, who could not think 
what else to say. ÒEr Ñ IÕm just
 going over here with . . .Ó 
He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly. 
ÒTold you,Ó said Hermione succinctly. ÒSooner you ask some-
one, sooner theyÕll all leav
e you alone and you can ÑÓ 
But her face suddenly turned bl
ank; she had just spotted Ron 
and Lavender, who were entwin
ed in the same armchair. 
ÒWell, good night, Harry,Ó said 
Hermione, though it was only 
seven oÕclock in the evening, and 
she left for the girlsÕ dormitory 
without another word. 
Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one 
more day of lessons to struggle thro
ugh, plus SlughornÕs party, after 
which he and Ron would depart to
gether for the Burrow. It now 
seemed impossible that Ron and 
Hermione would make up with 
each other before the holidays be
gan, but perhaps, somehow, the 
break would give them time to ca
lm down, think better of their 
behavior. . . . 
But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after en-
during a Transfiguration lesson with
 them both next day. They had 
just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Trans-
figuration; working in front of mi
rrors, they were supposed to be 
changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed  
 !#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,<-" unkindly at RonÕs disastrous firs
t attempt, during which he some-
how managed to give himself a 
spectacular handlebar mustache; 
Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermi-
one jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGon-
agall asked a question, which Lav
ender and Parvati found deeply 
amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. 
She raced out of the classroom on 
the bell, leaving half her things 
behind; Harry, deciding that her 
need was greater than RonÕs just 
now, scooped up her remaining 
possessions and followed her. 
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girlsÕ bath-
room on the floor below. She wa
s accompanied by Luna Lovegood, 
who was patting her va
guely on the back. 
ÒOh, hello, Harry,Ó said Luna. ÒDid you know one of your eye-
brows is bright yellow?Ó 
ÒHi, Luna. Hermione, you l
eft your stuff. . . .Ó 
He held out her books. 
ÒOh yes,Ó said Hermione in a chok
ed voice, taking her things 
and turning away quickly to hide 
the fact that she was wiping her 
eyes on her pencil case. ÒThank 
you, Harry. Well, IÕd better get go-
ing. . . .Ó 
And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer 
words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. 
ÒSheÕs a bit upset,Ó said Luna. ÒI
 thought at first it was Moaning 
Myrtle in there, but it turned ou
t to be Hermione. She said some-
thing about that Ro
n Weasley. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, theyÕve had a row,Ó said Harry. 
ÒHe says very funny things sometime
s, doesnÕt he?Ó said Luna, as 
they set off down the corridor toge
ther. ÒBut he can be a bit un-
kind. I noticed that last year.Ó 
&#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,<<" ÒI sÕpose,Ó said Harry. Luna wa
s demonstrating her usual knack 
of speaking uncomfortable truths
; he had never met anyone quite 
like her. ÒSo have 
you had a good term?Ó 
ÒOh, itÕs been all right,Ó said 
Luna. ÒA bit lonely without the 
D.A. GinnyÕs been nice, though. 
She stopped two boys in our 
Transfiguration class calling 
me ÔLoonyÕ the other day ÑÓ 
ÒHow would you like to come to SlughornÕs party with me 
tonight?Ó 
The words were out of HarryÕs 
mouth before he could stop 
them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger 
speaking. Luna turned her protuberant 
eyes upon him in surprise. 
ÒSlughornÕs party? With you?Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry. ÒWeÕre supp
osed to bring guests, so I 
thought you might like . . . I mean
 . . .Ó He was keen to make his 
intentions perfectly clear. ÒI mean, 
just as friends, you know. But if 
you donÕt want to . . .Ó 
He was already half hoping 
that she didnÕt want to. 
ÒOh, no, IÕd love to go with yo
u as friends!Ó said Luna, beaming 
as he had never 
seen her beam before. ÒNob
odyÕs ever asked me to 
a party before, as a friend! Is that
 why you dyed your eyebrow, for 
the party? Should
 I do mine too?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry firmly, Òthat wa
s a mistake. IÕll get Hermione 
to put it right for me. So, IÕll meet
 you in the entra
nce hall at eight 
oÕclock then.Ó 
ÒAHA!Ó screamed a voice from 
overhead and both of them 
jumped; unnoticed by either of th
em, they had just passed right 
underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chande-
lier and grinning maliciously at them.

ÒNice to keep these things pr

enough, in no time at all the wh
ole school seemed to know that 
Harry Potter was taking Luna Lo
vegood to SlughornÕs party. 
ÒYou couldÕve taken 
anyone!Ó said Ron in disbelief over dinner. 
ÒAnyone

oony Lovegood?Ó 
ÒDonÕt call her that, Ron,Ó snapped Ginny, pausing behind 
Harry on her way to join friends. ÒIÕm
 really glad youÕre taking her, 
Harry, sheÕs so excited.Ó 
And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried 
to feel pleased that Ginny was glad 
he was taking Luna to the party, 
but could not quite manage it. A 
long way along the table, Hermi-
one was sitting alone, playing wi
th her stew. Harry noticed Ron 
looking at her furtively. 
ÒYou could say sorry,Ó su
ggested Harry bluntly. 
ÒWhat, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?Ó muttered 
Ron. ÒWhat did you have to
 imitate her for?Ó 
ÒShe laughed at

ÒSo did I, it was the stupidest thing IÕve ever seen.Ó 
But Ron did not seem to have he

with Parvati. Squeezing hersel

around RonÕs neck. 
ÒHi, Harry,Ó said Parvati who, li

Parvati positively beamed. Harry 
could tell that she was feeling

ble even more brightly. Girls 
were very strange sometimes. 
ÒHi, Parvati!Ó said Hermione,

 ,<6" She left. At once Lavender and 
Parvati put their heads together 
to discuss this new development, 
with everything they had ever 
heard about McLaggen, and all th
ey had ever guessed about Her-
mione. Ron looked strangely blan
k and said nothing. Harry was 
left to ponder in sil
ence the depths to which girls would sink to get 
revenge. When he arrived in the entrance hall
 at eight oÕcloc
k that night, 
he found an unusually large number
 of girls lurking there, all of 
whom seemed to be staring at hi
m resentfully as he approached 
Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were at-
tracting a certain amount of gigg
les from the onlookers, but other-
wise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she 
had left off her radish
 earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and 
her Spectrespecs. 
ÒHi,Ó he said. ÒShall 
we get going then?Ó 
ÒOh yes,Ó she said happily. ÒWhere is the party?Ó 
ÒSlughornÕs office,Ó said Harry, 
leading her up the marble stair-
case away from all the staring and muttering. ÒDid you hear, thereÕs 
supposed to be a vampire coming?Ó 
ÒRufus Scrimgeour

ÒI Ñ what?Ó said Harry, discon
certed. ÒYou mean the Minister 
of Magic?Ó 
ÒYes, heÕs a vampire,Ó said Luna 
matter-of-factly. ÒFather wrote a

Cornelius Fudge, but he was forc

 ,<7" views as though they were fact, 
did not reply; they were already 
approaching SlughornÕs office and the sounds of laughter, music, 
and loud conversation were growin
g louder with every step they 
took. 
Whether it had been built that wa
y, or because he had used mag-
ical trickery to make it so, SlughornÕs office was much larger than 
the usual teacherÕs study. The ce
iling and walls had been draped 
with emerald, crimson, and gold 
hangings, so that it looked as 
though they were all inside a va
st tent. The room was crowded and 
stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp 
dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were 
fluttering, each a brilliant speck 
of light. Loud singing accompa-
nied by what sounded like mandol
ins issued from a distant corner; 
a haze of pipe smoke hung over 
several elderly warlocks deep in 
conversation, and a number of ho
use-elves were negotiating their 
way squeakily through the forest 
of knees, obscured by the heavy 
silver platters of food they were bear
ing, so that they
 looked like lit-
tle roving tables. 
ÒHarry, mÕboy!Ó boomed Slughorn
, almost as soon as Harry and 
Luna had squeezed in through 
the door. ÒCome in, come in, so 
many people IÕd li
ke you to meet!Ó 
Slughorn was wearing a tasseled ve
lvet hat to match his smoking 
jacket. Gripping HarryÕs arm so ti
ghtly he might have been hoping 
to Disapparate with him, Slugho
rn led him purposefully into the 
party; Harry seized LunaÕs hand
 and dragged her 
along with him. 
ÒHarry, IÕd like you to meet El
dred Worple, an old student of 
mine, author of 
Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires
 Ñ 
and, of course, his friend Sanguini.Ó 
Worple, who was a small, stout,
 bespectacled man, grabbed 
!#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,<8" HarryÕs hand and shook it enthusia
stically; the vampire Sanguini, 
who was tall and emaciated with
 dark shadows under his eyes, 
merely nodded. He looked rather
 bored. A gaggle of girls was 
standing close to him, lo
oking curious and excited. 
ÒHarry Potter, I am simply delighted!Ó said Worple, peering 
shortsightedly up into HarryÕs fa
ce. ÒI was saying to Professor 
Slughorn only the other day, Ô
Where is the biography of Harry Potter 
for which we have all been waiting
?ÕÓ 
ÒEr,Ó said Harry, Òwere you?Ó 
ÒJust as modest as Horace described!Ó said Worple. ÒBut seri-
ouslyÓ Ñ his manner changed; it
 became suddenly businesslike Ñ 
ÒI would be delighted to write it
 myself Ñ people are craving to 
know more about you, dear boy, cr
aving! If you were prepared to 
grant me a few interviews, say in 
four- or five-hour sessions, why, 
we could have the book finished 
within months. And all with very 
little effort on your part, I assure 
you Ñ ask Sanguini here if it isnÕt 
quite Ñ 
Sanguini, stay here
!Ó added Worple, su
ddenly stern, for 
the vampire had been edging toward
 the nearby group of girls, a 
rather hungry look in his eye. ÒH
ere, have a pasty,Ó said Worple, 
seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into SanguiniÕs hand 
before turning his attention back to Harry. 
ÒMy dear boy, the gold you coul
d make, you have no idea ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm definitely not interested,Ó 
said Harry firmly, Òand IÕve just 
seen a friend of mine, sorry.Ó 
He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just 
seen a long mane of 
brown hair disappear 
between what looked 
like two members of 
the Weird Sisters. 
ÒHermione! Hermione!Ó ÒHarry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!Ó 
&#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,<9" ÒWhatÕs happened to you?Ó aske
d Harry, for Hermione looked 
distinctly disheveled, rather as th
ough she had just fought her way 
out of a thicket of DevilÕs Snare. 
ÒOh, IÕve just escaped Ñ I mean
, IÕve just left
 Cormac,Ó she 
said. ÒUnder the mistletoe,Ó she 
added in explanation, as Harry 
continued to look questioningly at her. 
ÒServes you right for coming with
 him,Ó he told her severely. 
ÒI thought heÕd annoy Ron most
,Ó said Hermione dispassion-
ately. ÒI debated for a while abou
t Zacharias Smith, but I thought, 
on the whole ÑÓ 
ÒYou considered Smith
?Ó said Harry, revolted. 
ÒYes, I did, and IÕm starting to wish IÕd chosen him, McLaggen 
makes Grawp look a gentleman. LetÕs 
go this way, weÕll be able to 
see him coming, heÕs
 so tall. . . .Ó 
The three of them made their way 
over to the othe
r side of the 
room, scooping up goblets of mead 
on the way, realizing too late 
that Professor Trelawney wa
s standing there alone. 
ÒHello,Ó said Luna politely
 to Professor Trelawney. 
ÒGood evening, my dear,Ó said 
Professor Trelawney, focusing 
upon Luna with some difficulty
. Harry could smell cooking sherry 
again. ÒI havenÕt seen you in my classes lately. . . .Ó 
ÒNo, IÕve got Firenze th
is year,Ó said Luna. 
ÒOh, of course,Ó said Profe
ssor Trelawney with an angry, 
drunken titter. ÒOr Dobbin, as I pr
efer to think of 
him. You would 
have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school 
Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no . . . 
we share classes. . . . ItÕs an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you 
know . . .Ó 
Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. 
!#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,<:" Under cover of her furious criticisms
 of Firenze, Harry drew closer 
to Hermione and said, ÒLetÕs get 
something straight. Are you plan-
ning to tell Ron that you in
terfered at Keeper tryouts?Ó 
Hermione raised her eyebrows. 
ÒDo you really think IÕd stoop 
that low?Ó 
Harry looked at her shrewdly. ÒH
ermione, if you can ask out 
McLaggen ÑÓ 
ÒThereÕs a difference,Ó said Hermio
ne with dignity. ÒIÕve got no 
plans to tell Ron anything about wh
at might, or might not, have 
happened at Keeper tryouts.Ó 
ÒGood,Ó said Harry fervently. ÒBecause
 heÕll just fall apart again, 
and weÕll lose the next match ÑÓ 
ÒQuidditch!Ó said Hermione angrily. 
ÒIs that all boys care about? 
Cormac hasnÕt asked me one single
 question about myself, no, IÕve 
just been treated to ÔA Hundre
d Great Saves Made by Cormac 
McLaggenÕ nonstop ever since 
Ñ oh no, here he comes!Ó 
She moved so fast it was as th
ough she had Disapparated; one 
moment she was there, the next
, she had squeezed between two 
guffawing witches and vanished. 
ÒSeen Hermione?Ó asked McLagg
en, forcing his way through 
the throng a minute later. 
ÒNo, sorry,Ó said Harry, and he tu
rned quickly to join in LunaÕs 
conversation, forgetting for a split 
second to whom she was talking. 
ÒHarry Potter!Ó said Professor 
Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, 
noticing him for the first time. 
ÒOh, hello,Ó said Harry unenthusiastically. 
ÒMy dear boy!Ó she said in a ve
ry carrying whisper. ÒThe rumors! 
The stories! ÔThe Chosen OneÕ! Of course, I have known for a very 
long time. . . . The omens were 
never good, Harry. . . . But why 
&#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,<;" have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the 
subject is of the utmost importance!Ó 
ÒAh, Sybill, we all think our su
bjectÕs most important!Ó said a 
loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor TrelawneyÕs other 
side, his face very red,
 his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead 
in one hand and an enormous mince 
pie in the other. ÒBut I donÕt 
think IÕve ever known such a natural at Potions!Ó said Slughorn, re-
garding Harry with a fond, if bl
oodshot, eye. ÒInstinctive, you 
know Ñ like his mother! IÕve only 
ever taught a few with this kind 
of ability, I can tell you that
, Sybill Ñ why even Severus ÑÓ 
And to HarryÕs horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed 
to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. 
ÒStop skulking and come and join us, Severus!Ó hiccuped 
Slughorn happily. ÒI was just ta
lking about HarryÕs exceptional po-
tion-making! Some credit must go
 to you, of course, you taught 
him for five years!Ó 
Trapped, with SlughornÕs arm 
around his shoulders, Snape 
looked down his hooked 
nose at Harry, his 
black eyes narrowed. 
ÒFunny, I never had the impressi
on that I managed to teach 
Potter anything at all.Ó 
ÒWell, then, itÕs natural ability!Ó shouted Slughorn. ÒYou should 
have seen what he gave me, first 
lesson, Draught of Living Death Ñ 
never had a student produce finer on
 a first attempt, I donÕt think 
even you, Severus ÑÓ 
ÒReally?Ó said Snape quietly, his ey
es still boring into Harry, who 
felt a certain disquiet. The last th
ing he wanted was for Snape to 
start investigating the source of hi
s newfound brilliance at Potions. 
ÒRemind me what other subjects
 youÕre taking, Harry?Ó asked 
Slughorn. 
!#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,=-" ÒDefense Against the Dark Arts
, Charms, Transfiguration, 
Herbology . . .Ó 
ÒAll the subjects required, in shor
t, for an Auror,Ó said Snape, 
with the faintest sneer. 
ÒYeah, well, thatÕs what IÕd like to do,Ó said Harry defiantly. 
ÒAnd a great one youÕll make too!Ó boomed Slughorn. 
ÒI donÕt think you should be an 
Auror, Harry,Ó said Luna unex-
pectedly. Everybody looked at her.
 ÒThe Aurors are part of the 
Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought ev
eryone knew that. TheyÕre work-
ing to bring down the Ministry of 
Magic from within using a com-
bination of Dark Ma
gic and gum disease.Ó 
Harry inhaled half his mead up his 
nose as he started to laugh. 
Really, it had been worth bringing
 Luna just for this. Emerging 
from his goblet, coughing, sopping
 wet but still grinning, he saw 
something calculated to raise his 
spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy 
being dragged by th
e ear toward them by Argus Filch. 
ÒProfessor Slughorn,Ó wheezed Fi
lch, his jowls aquiver and the 
maniacal light of mischief-detectio
n in his bulging eyes, ÒI discov-
ered this boy lurking in an upstai
rs corridor. He claims to have 
been invited to your pa
rty and to have been delayed in setting out. 
Did you issue him with
 an invitation?Ó 
Malfoy pulled himself free of 
FilchÕs grip, looking furious. 
ÒAll right, I wasnÕt invited!Ó he said angrily. ÒI was trying to gate-
crash, happy?Ó 
ÒNo, IÕm not!Ó said Filch, a stat
ement at complete odds with the 
glee on his face. ÒYouÕre in trouble,
 you are! DidnÕt the headmaster 
say that nighttime prowlingÕs out, unless youÕve got permission, 
didnÕt he, eh?Ó 
ÒThatÕs all right, Argus, thatÕs al
l right,Ó said Slughorn, waving a 
&#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,=<" hand. ÒItÕs Christmas, and itÕs no
t a crime to want to come to a 
party. Just this once, weÕll forg
et any punishment; you may stay, 
Draco.Ó 
FilchÕs expression of outraged 
disappointment was perfectly pre-
dictable; but why, Harry wonder
ed, watching him, did Malfoy 
look almost equally unhappy? An
d why was Snape 
looking at Mal-
foy as though both angry and . . . wa
s it possible? . . . a little afraid? 
But almost before Harry had regi
stered what he had seen, Filch 
had turned and shuffled away, mu
ttering under his breath; Malfoy 
had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for 
his generosity, and Snap
eÕs face was smoothly
 inscrutable again. 
ÒItÕs nothing, nothing,Ó said Sl
ughorn, waving away MalfoyÕs 
thanks. ÒI did know your gran
dfather, after all. . . .Ó 
ÒHe always spoke very highly of 
you, sir,Ó said Malfoy quickly. 
ÒSaid you were the best potion-maker heÕd ever known. . . .Ó 
Harry stared at Malfoy. It was no
t the sucking-up that intrigued 
him; he had watched Malf
oy do that to Snape for a long time. It 
was the fact that Malfoy did, after 
all, look a little ill. This was the 
first time he had seen Malfoy cl
ose up for ages; he now saw that 
Malfoy had dark shadows under his
 eyes and a distinctly grayish 
tinge to his skin. 
ÒIÕd like a word with you, Draco,Ó said Snape suddenly. 
ÒOh, now, Severus,Ó said Slughorn
, hiccuping again, ÒitÕs Christ-
mas, donÕt be 
too hard ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm his Head of House, and I 
shall decide how hard, or other-
wise, to be,Ó said Snape 
curtly. ÒFollow me, Draco.Ó 
They left, Snape leading the wa
y, Malfoy looking resentful. 
Harry stood there for a moment, irreso
lute, then said, ÒIÕll be back 
in a bit, Luna Ñ er Ñ bathroom.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,==" ÒAll right,Ó she said cheerfully, 
and he thought he heard her, as 
he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang 
Conspiracy with Professor Trelaw
ney, who seemed sincerely inter-
ested. 
It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak 
out of his pocket and throw it ov
er himself, for the corridor was 
quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and 
Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor,
 the noise of his feet masked 
by the music and loud talk still is
suing from SlughornÕs office be-
hind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dun-
geons . . . or perhaps he was esco
rting him back to the Slytherin 
common room. . . . Harry pressed his
 ear against door after door as 
he dashed down the corridor until, 
with a great jolt of excitement, 
he crouched down to the keyhole of
 the last classroom in the corri-
dor and heard voices. 
Ò. . . cannot afford mistakes, 
Draco, because if you are ex-
pelled ÑÓ 
ÒI didnÕt have anything 
to do with it, all right?Ó 
ÒI hope you are telling the truth,
 because it was both clumsy and 
foolish. Already you are suspecte
d of having a 
hand in it.Ó 
ÒWho suspects me?Ó said Malfoy angrily. ÒFor the last time, I 
didnÕt do it, okay? That Bell gi
rl mustÕve had an enemy no one 
knows about Ñ donÕt look at me li
ke that! I know what youÕre do-
ing, IÕm not stupid, but it wo
nÕt work Ñ I can stop you!Ó 
There was a pause and then Snape 
said quietly, ÒAh . . . Aunt 
Bellatrix has been teac
hing you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts 
are you trying to 
conceal from your master, Draco?Ó 
ÒIÕm not trying to conceal anything from 
him, I just donÕt want 
you butting in!Ó 
&#'"".+/('$0$/1'""234"
 ,=," Harry pressed his ear still more cl
osely against the keyhole. . . . 
What had happened to make Malfoy
 speak to Snape like this Ñ 
Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? 
ÒSo that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have 
feared my interference? You realize 
that, had anybody 
else failed to 
come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, 
Draco ÑÓ 
ÒSo put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!Ó jeered 
Malfoy. 
There was another pause. Then Snape said, ÒYou know perfectly 
well that I do not wish to 
do either of th
ose things.Ó 
ÒYouÕd better stop telling me to come to your office then!Ó 
ÒListen to me,Ó said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had 
to push his ear very hard against 
the keyhole to hear. ÒI am trying 
to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made 
the Unbreakable Vow, Draco ÑÓ 
ÒLooks like youÕll have to brea
k it, then, because I donÕt need 
your protection! ItÕs my job, he ga
ve it to me and IÕm doing it, IÕve 
got a plan and itÕs going to work, it
Õs just taking a bit longer than I 
thought it would!Ó 
ÒWhat is your plan?Ó 
ÒItÕs none of your business!Ó 
ÒIf you tell me what you are tryi
ng to do, I can assist you ÑÓ 
ÒIÕve got all the assistance I 
need, thanks, IÕm not alone!Ó 
ÒYou were certainly alone tonigh
t, which was foolish in the ex-
treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these 
are elementary mistakes ÑÓ 
ÒI wouldÕve had Crabbe and Goyl
e with me if you hadnÕt put 
them in detention!Ó 
!#$%&'("")*)&''+"
 ,=6" ÒKeep your voice down!Ó spat Sn
ape, for MalfoyÕs voice had 
risen excitedly. ÒIf your friends 
Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass 
their Defense Against the Dark Arts
 O.W.L. this time around, they 
will need to work a little harder 
than they are do
ing at pres ÑÓ 
ÒWhat does it matter?Ó said Ma
lfoy. ÒDefense Against the Dark 
Arts Ñ itÕs all just a joke, isnÕt it
, an act? Like any of us need pro-
tecting against the Dark Arts ÑÓ 
ÒIt is an act that is crucial to 
success, Draco!Ó said Snape. ÒWhere 
do you think I would have been all 
these years, if I had not known 
how to act? Now listen to me! Yo
u are being incautious, wandering 
around at night, getting yourself
 caught, and if 
you are placing 
your reliance in 
assistants like Crabbe and Goyle ÑÓ 
ÒTheyÕre not the only ones, IÕve got other people on my side, 
better people!Ó 
ÒThen why not confide 
in me, and I can ÑÓ 
ÒI know what youÕre up to! 
You want to steal my glory!Ó 
There was another pause, then 
Snape said coldly, ÒYou are 
speaking like a child. I quite unde
rstand that your fatherÕs capture 
and imprisonment has upset you, but ÑÓ 
Harry had barely a secondÕs warnin
g; he heard MalfoyÕs footsteps 
on the other side of the door and 
flung himself out 
of the way just 
as it burst open; Malfoy was stri
ding away down the corridor, past 
the open door of SlughornÕs office, around the distant corner, and 
out of sight. 
Hardly daring to breathe, Ha
rry remained crouched down as 
Snape emerged slowly from the cl
assroom. His expression unfath-
omable, he returned to the party.
 Harry remained on the floor, hid-
den beneath the cloak, his mind racing.

ÒYeah, well, passing over

George, Òwhat is this we hear

Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he 
turned back to the sprouts.
 ÒMind your own business.Ó

ÒYep,Ó said Harry. ÒIÕm going to

ÒPity you didnÕt hear what Malf

ÒI couldnÕt have done, could I? 
That was the whole point, he was

There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, ÒÕCourse,

Harry said nothing. It had alre
ady occurred to him that this 
would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could 
hear Hermione now: 
Obviously, Harry, he wa
s pretending to offer 
help so he could trick Malfoy in
to telling him what heÕs doing.
 . . . This was pure imagination, howe
ver, as he had had no opportu-
nity to tell Hermione what he 
had overheard. She had disappeared 
from SlughornÕs parry before he re
turned to it, or so he had been 
informed by an irate McLaggen, 
and she had already gone to bed 
by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had 
left for the Burrow earl
y the next day, he had barely had time to 
wish her a happy Christ
mas and to tell her th
at he had some very 
important news when they got back
 from the holidays. He was not 
entirely sure that she had hear
d him, though; Ron and Lavender 
had been saying a thoroughly no
nverbal good-bye just behind him 
at the time. 
Still, even Hermione would not be
 able to deny one thing: Mal-
foy was definitely up to somethin
g, and Snape knew it, so Harry 
felt fully justified in saying ÒI to
ld you so,Ó which he had done sev-
eral times to Ron already. 
Harry did not get the chance to 
speak to Mr. Weasley, who was 
working very long hours at the 
Ministry, until Christmas Eve 
night. The Weasleys and their gues
ts were sitting in the living 
room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like 
sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron 
were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 --9" actually a garden gnome that had 
bitten Fred on the ankle as he 
pulled up carrots for Christmas 
dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, 
stuffed into a miniature tutu an
d with small wing
s glued to its 
back, it glowered down at them all,
 the ugliest angel Harry had ever 
seen, with a large bald head like
 a potato and rather hairy feet. 
They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast 
by Mrs. WeasleyÕs favorite singer
, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice 
was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed 
to find Celestina very dull, was talkin
g so loudly in the corner that a 
scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-
trol, so that Celestina grew louder
 and louder. Under cover of a par-
ticularly jazzy number called ÒA 
Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong 
Love,Ó Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with 
Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and 
Fleur covert looks, as though 
hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhil
e, Remus Lupin, who was thinner 
and more ragged-looking than ever, 
was sitting beside the fire, star-
ing into its depths as though he could not hear CelestinaÕs voice. 
 Oh, come and stir my cauldron, 
And if you do it right, 
IÕll boil you up some hot strong love 
To keep you warm tonight.
  ÒWe danced to this when we were
 eighteen!Ó said Mrs. Weasley, 
wiping her eyes on her knitti
ng. ÒDo you remember, Arthur?Ó 
ÒMphf?Ó said Mr. Weasley, whos
e head had been nodding over 
the satsuma he was peeling. ÒOh 
yes . . . marvelous tune . . .Ó 
With an effort, he sat up a little
 straighter and looked around at 
Harry, who was sitting next to him. 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" --:" ÒSorry about this,Ó he said, jerkin
g his head toward the wireless 
as Celestina broke into th
e chorus. ÒBe over soon.Ó 
ÒNo problem,Ó said Harry, grinning. ÒHas it been busy at the 
Ministry?Ó 
ÒVery,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒI wouldnÕt mind if we were getting 
anywhere, but of the three arrests we
Õve made in the last couple of 
months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater Ñ only 
donÕt repeat that, Harry,Ó he a
dded quickly, looking much more 
awake all of a sudden. 
ÒTheyÕre not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒIÕm afraid so,Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒI know DumbledoreÕs tried 
appealing directly to Scrimgeour 
about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody 
who has actually interviewed him agrees that heÕs about as much a 
Death Eater as this satsuma . . . bu
t the top levels want to look as 
though theyÕre making some progre
ss, and Ôthree arrestsÕ sounds 
better than Ôthree mistaken arrests and 
releasesÕ. . . but again, this is 
all top secret. . . .Ó 
ÒI wonÕt say anything,Ó said Harr
y. He hesitated for a moment, 
wondering how best to embark on 
what he wanted to say; as he 
marshaled his thoughts, Celestina 
Warbeck began a ballad called 
ÒYou Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.Ó 
ÒMr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we 
were setting off for school?Ó 
ÒI checked, Harry,Ó said Mr. Weasley at once. ÒI went and 
searched the MalfoysÕ house. Ther
e was nothing, either broken or 
whole, that shouldnÕt have been there.Ó 
ÒYeah, I know, I saw in the 
Prophet that youÕd looked . . . but this 
is something different. . . . 
Well, something more . . .Ó 
And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 --." Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw LupinÕs head turn a lit-
tle toward him, taking in every 
word. When he had finished, there 
was silence, except for CelestinaÕs crooning. 
 Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? 
ItÕs left me for a spell . . .
  ÒHas it occurred to you, Harry,Ó 
said Mr. Weasley, Òthat Snape 
was simply pretending Ñ ?Ó 
ÒPretending to offer help, so th
at he could find out what Mal-
foyÕs up to?Ó said Harry quickly.
 ÒYeah, I thought youÕd say that. 
But how do we know?Ó 
ÒIt isnÕt our business to know,Ó 
said Lupin unexpectedly. He had 
turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. 
Weasley. ÒItÕs DumbledoreÕs business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, 
and that ought to be good 
enough for all of us.Ó 
ÒBut,Ó said Harry, Òjust say Ñ just say DumbledoreÕs wrong 
about Snape ÑÓ 
ÒPeople have said it, many times.
 It comes down to whether or 
not you trust DumbledoreÕs judgment. I do; therefore, I trust 
Severus.Ó ÒBut Dumbledore can make mistak
es,Ó argued Harry. ÒHe says 
it himself. And youÓ Ñ he looked
 Lupin straight in the eye Ñ Òdo 
you honestly like Snape?Ó 
ÒI neither like nor dislike Severus,Ó said Lupin. ÒNo, Harry, I am 
speaking the truth,Ó he added, as
 Harry pulled a skeptical expres-
sion. ÒWe shall never be bosom fri
ends, perhaps; after all that hap-
pened between James and Sirius an
d Severus, there is too much 
bitterness there. But I do not forget 
that during the year I taught at 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" ---" Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every 
month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-
ally do at the 
full moon.Ó 
ÒBut he ÔaccidentallyÕ let it slip 
that youÕre a werewolf, so you had 
to leave!Ó said 
Harry angrily. 
Lupin shrugged. ÒThe news would have leaked out anyway. We 
both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much 
worse damage on me by tamperin
g with the potion. He kept me 
healthy. I must be grateful.Ó 
ÒMaybe he didnÕt da
re mess with the potion with Dumbledore 
watching him!Ó said Harry. 
ÒYou are determined to hate hi
m, Harry,Ó said Lupin with a 
faint smile. ÒAnd I understand; with
 James as your father, with Sir-
ius as your godfather, you have in
herited an old prejudice. By all 
means tell Dumbledore what you ha
ve told Arthur and me, but do 
not expect him to share your view
 of the matter; do not even expect 
him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on 
DumbledoreÕs orders that Se
verus questioned Draco.Ó 
 . . . and now youÕve 
torn it quite apart 
IÕll thank you to give back my heart! 
 Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and 
loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined 
in with enthusiastically. 
ÒEez eet over?Ó said 
Fleur loudly. ÒThank goodness, what an Õor-
rible ÑÓ 
ÒShall we have a nightcap, then?Ó asked Mr. Weasley loudly, 
leaping to his feet. 
ÒWho wants eggnog?Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 --;" ÒWhat have you been up
 to lately?Ó Harry asked Lupin, as Mr. 
Weasley bustled off to fetch th
e eggnog, and everybody else 
stretched and broke into conversation. 
ÒOh, IÕve been underground,Ó said Lupin. ÒAlmost literally. 
ThatÕs why I havenÕt been able to 
write, Harry; sending letters to 
you would have been something of a giveaway.Ó 
ÒWhat do you mean?Ó 
ÒIÕve been living among my fellows, my equals,Ó said Lupin. 
ÒWerewolves,Ó he added, at Har
ryÕs look of incomprehension. 
ÒNearly all of them are on Vold
emortÕs side. Dumbledore wanted a 
spy and here I was 
. . . ready-made.Ó 
He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled 
more warmly as he went on, ÒI am
 not complaining; it is necessary 
work and who can do it 
better than I? Howeve
r, it has been diffi-
cult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having 
tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned 
normal society and live on the ma
rgins, stealing Ñ and sometimes 
killing Ñ to eat.Ó 
ÒHow come they like Voldemort?Ó 
ÒThey think that, under 
his rule, they will ha
ve a better life,Ó 
said Lupin. ÒAnd it is hard to ar
gue with Greyback 
out there. . . .Ó 
ÒWhoÕs Greyback?Ó 
ÒYou havenÕt heard of him?Ó LupinÕ
s hands closed convulsively in 
his lap. ÒFenrir Greyba
ck is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf 
alive today. He regards it as his mi
ssion in life to bite and to conta-
minate as many people as possible;
 he wants to create enough were-
wolves to overcome the wizards. 
Voldemort has promised him prey 
in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite 
them young, he says, and raise them
 away from their parents, raise 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" --/" them to hate normal wizards. Vo
ldemort has threatened to unleash 
him upon peopleÕs sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually 
produces good results.Ó 
Lupin paused and then said, ÒI
t was Greyback 
who bit me.Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó said Harry, astonish
ed. ÒWhen Ñ when you were a 
kid, you mean?Ó 
ÒYes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very 
long time, the id
entity of the werewolf 
who had atta
cked me; I 
even felt pity for him, thinking that
 he had had no control, know-
ing by then how it felt to transfor
m. But Greyback is not like that. 
At the full moon, he positions hi
mself close to victims, ensuring 
that he is near enough to strike. He
 plans it all. And this is the man 
Voldemort is using to marshal 
the werewolves. I cannot pretend 
that my particular brand of reas
oned argument is making much 
headway against GreybackÕs insisten
ce that we werewolves deserve 
blood, that we ought 
to revenge ourselves 
on normal people.Ó 
ÒBut you are normal!Ó said Harry 
fiercely. ÒYouÕve just got a Ñ a 
problem ÑÓ 
Lupin burst out laughing. ÒSomet
imes you remind me a lot of 
James. He called it my Ôfurry li
ttle problemÕ in company. Many 
people were under the impression
 that I owned 
a badly behaved 
rabbit.Ó He accepted a glass of eggnog fr
om Mr. Weasley with a word of 
thanks, looking slightly more ch
eerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a 
rush of excitement: This last me
ntion of his father had reminded 
him that there was so
mething he had been l
ooking forward to ask-
ing Lupin. 
ÒHave you ever heard of someone 
called the Half-Blood Prince?Ó 
ÒThe Half-Blood what?Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 --5" ÒPrince,Ó said Harry, watching him
 closely for signs of recogni-
tion. 
ÒThere are no Wizarding princes,
Ó said Lupin, now smiling. ÒIs 
this a title youÕre thinking of ad
opting? I should have thought be-
ing Ôthe Chosen OneÕ
 would be enough.Ó 
ÒItÕs nothing to do with me!Ó sa
id Harry indignantly. ÒThe Half-
Blood Prince is someone who used to
 go to Hogwarts, IÕve got his 
old Potions book. He wrote spells 
all over it, spells he invented. 
One of them was Levicorpus ÑÓ 
ÒOh, that one had a great vogue 
during my time at Hogwarts,Ó 
said Lupin reminiscently. ÒThere 
were a few months in my fifth 
year when you couldnÕt move for be
ing hoisted into the air by your 
ankle.Ó ÒMy dad used it,Ó said Harry. ÒI 
saw him in the Pensieve, he used 
it on Snape.Ó 
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-
ment of no real importance, but 
he was not sure he had achieved 
the right effect; LupinÕs smile 
was a little too understanding. 
ÒYes,Ó he said, Òbut he wasnÕt the only one. As I say, it was very 
popular. . . . You know how thes
e spells come and go. . . .Ó 
ÒBut it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,Ó 
Harry persisted. 
ÒNot necessarily,Ó said Lupin. ÒJ
inxes go in and out of fashion 
like everything else.Ó 
He looked into HarryÕs face and 
then said quietly, ÒJames was a 
pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 
ÔPrince.ÕÓ 
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, ÒAnd it wasnÕt Sirius? Or you?Ó 
 $""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" --6" ÒDefinitely not.Ó 
ÒOh.Ó Harry stared into the fire. ÒI just thought Ñ well, heÕs 
helped me out a lot in Potion
s classes, the Prince has.Ó 
ÒHow old is this
 book, Harry?Ó 
ÒI dunno, IÕve never checked.Ó 
ÒWell, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the 
Prince was at Hogwar
ts,Ó said Lupin. 
Shortly after this, Fleur decided 
to imitate Celestina singing ÒA 
Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love
,Ó which was taken by everyone, 
once they had glimpsed Mrs. WeasleyÕs expression, to be the cue to 
go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed 
all the way up to RonÕs attic 
bedroom, where a camp bed 
had been adde
d for Harry. 
Ron fell asleep almost immediatel
y, but Harry delved into his 
trunk and pulled out his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 before 
getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he 
finally found, at the front of the 
book, the date that it had been pub-
lished. It was nearly fifty years old. 
Neither his father, nor his fatherÕs 
friends, had been at Hogwarts fift
y years ago. Feeling disappointed, 
Harry threw the book back into his 
trunk, turned off the lamp, and 
rolled over, thinking of werewolves
 and Snape, Stan Shunpike and 
the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of 
creeping shadows and the crie
s of bitten children. . . . 
ÒSheÕs got to be joking. . . .Ó 
Harry woke with a start to find a 
bulging stocking lying over the 
end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny 
window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front 
of it, Ron was sitting bolt uprigh
t in bed and examining what ap-
peared to be a thick gold chain. 
 !#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 --7" ÒWhatÕs that?Ó 
asked Harry. 
ÒItÕs from Lavender,Ó said Ron,
 sounding revolted. ÒShe canÕt 
honestly think IÕd wear . . .Ó 
Harry looked more closely and le
t out a shout of laughter. Dan-
gling from the chain in large 
gold letters were the words: 
!"#$%&&'(&)*'#
ÒNice,Ó he said. ÒClassy. You should
 definitely wear it in front of 
Fred and George.Ó 
ÒIf you tell them,Ó said Ron, sh
oving the necklace out of sight 
under his pillow, ÒI Ñ I Ñ IÕll ÑÓ 
ÒStutter at me?Ó said Harry, 
grinning. ÒCome on, would I?Ó 
ÒHow could she think IÕd like 
something like that, though?Ó 
Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked. 
ÒWell, think back,Ó sa
id Harry. ÒHave you ever let it slip that 
youÕd like to go out in public with the words ÔMy SweetheartÕ 
round your neck?Ó 
ÒWell . . . we donÕt really talk much
,Ó said Ron. ÒItÕs mainly . . .Ó 
ÒSnogging,Ó said Harry. 
ÒWell, yeah,Ó said Ron. He he
sitated a moment, then said, ÒIs 
Hermione really going out with McLaggen?Ó 
ÒI dunno,Ó said Harry. ÒThey were
 at SlughornÕs party together, 
but I donÕt think it 
went that well.Ó 
Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his 
stocking. 
HarryÕs presents included a sweate
r with a large Golden Snitch 
worked onto the front, hand-knitt
ed by Mrs. Weasley, a large box 
of WeasleysÕ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" --8" slightly damp, moldy-smelling pack
age that came with a label read-
ing 
To Master, From Kreacher
. Harry stared at it. ÒDÕy
ou reckon this is safe 
to open?Ó he asked. 
ÒCanÕt be anything dangerous, all our mailÕs still being searched 
at the Ministry,Ó replied Ron, th
ough he was eyeing the parcel 
suspiciously. ÒI didnÕt think of giving Kreach
er anything. Do people usually 
give their house-elves Christmas 
presents?Ó asked Harry, prodding 
the parcel cautiously. 
ÒHermione would,Ó said Ron. ÒBut letÕs wait and see what it is 
before you start feeling guilty.Ó 
A moment later, Harry had given a 
loud yell and leapt out of his 
camp bed; the package containe
d a large number of maggots. 
ÒNice,Ó said Ron, roaring with laughter. ÒVery thoughtful.Ó 
ÒIÕd rather have them than th
at necklace,Ó said Harry, which 
sobered Ron up at once. 
Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for 
Christmas lunch, everyone except
 Fleur (on whom, it appeared, 
Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley 
herself, who was sporting a bran
d-new midnight blue witchÕs hat 
glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-
tacular golden necklace. 
ÒFred and George gave them to
 me! ArenÕt they beautiful?Ó 
ÒWell, we find we appreciate
 you more and more, Mum, now 
weÕre washing our own socks,Ó said
 George, waving an airy hand. 
ÒParsnips,
 Remus?Ó 
ÒHarry, youÕve got a maggot in your
 hair,Ó said Ginny cheerfully, 
leaning across the table to pick it
 out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt 
up his neck that had nothin
g to do with the maggot. 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 -;9" ÒÕOw Õorrible,Ó said Fleur, wi
th an affected little shudder. 
ÒYes, isnÕt it?Ó said 
Ron. ÒGravy, Fleur?Ó 
In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; 
Bill waved his wand and the gravy so
ared up in the air and returned 
meekly to the boat. 
ÒYou are as bad as zat Tonks,Ó 
said Fleur to Ron, when she had 
finished kissing Bill in thanks. ÒShe is always knocking ÑÓ 
ÒI invited 
dear Tonks to come along toda
y,Ó said Mrs. Weasley, 
setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. 
ÒBut she wouldnÕt come. Have yo
u spoken to her lately, Remus?Ó 
ÒNo, I havenÕt been in contact with anybody very much,Ó said 
Lupin. ÒBut Tonks has got her own 
family to go to, hasnÕt she?Ó 
ÒHmmm,Ó said Mrs. Weasley. ÒM
aybe. I got the impression she 
was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.Ó 
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, 
as though it was all his fault 
she was getting Fleur for a daught
er-in-law instead of Tonks, but 
Harry, glancing across at Fleur, 
who was now feeding Bill bits of 
turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a 
long-lost battle. He was, however,
 reminded of a question he had 
with regard to Tonks, and who be
tter to ask than Lupin, the man 
who knew all about Patronuses? 
ÒTonksÕs Patronus has changed it
s form,Ó he told him. ÒSnape 
said so anyway. I didnÕt know th
at could happen. Why would your 
Patronus change?Ó 
Lupin took his time chewing his 
turkey and swallowing before 
saying slowly, ÒSometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional up-
heaval . . .Ó 
ÒIt looked big, and it had four le
gs,Ó said Harry, struck by a sud-
den thought and lowering his voice. ÒHey . . . it couldnÕt be Ñ ?Ó 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" -;:" ÒArthur!Ó said Mrs. Weasley su
ddenly. She had risen from her 
chair; her hand was pr
essed over her heart an
d she was staring out 
of the kitchen window. 
ÒArthur Ñ itÕs Percy!Ó 
ÒWhat
?Ó Mr. Weasley looked around. Ever
ybody looked quickly at the 
window; Ginny stood up for a better 
look. There, sure enough, was 
Percy Weasley, striding across 
the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed 
glasses glinting in the sunlight
. He was not, ho
wever, alone. 
ÒArthur, heÕs Ñ heÕs 
with the Mi
nister!Ó 
And sure enough, the ma
n Harry had seen in the 
Daily Prophet
 was following along in PercyÕs wa
ke, limping slightly, his mane of 
graying hair and his black cloak fl
ecked with snow. Before any of 
them could say anything, before
 Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do 
more than exchange stunned lo
oks, the back door opened and 
there stood Percy. 
There was a momentÕs painful silence. Then Percy said rather 
stiffly, ÒMerry Christmas, Mother.Ó 
ÒOh, Percy!Ó said Mrs. Weasley, and 
she threw herself into his 
arms. 
Rufus Scrimgeour paused in th
e doorway, leaning on his walk-
ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene. 
ÒYou must forgive this intrusio
n,Ó he said, when Mrs. Weasley 
looked around at him, beaming an
d wiping her eyes. ÒPercy and I 
were in the vicinity Ñ working, you know Ñ and he couldnÕt re-
sist dropping in an
d seeing you all.Ó 
But Percy showed no sign of want
ing to greet any of the rest of 
the family. He stood, poker-stra
ight and awkward-looking, and 
stared over everybody elseÕs head
s. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George 
were all observing him, stony-faced. 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 -;." ÒPlease, come in, sit down, Minister!Ó fluttered Mrs. Weasley, 
straightening her hat. ÒH
ave a little purkey, or
 some tooding. . . . I 
mean ÑÓ 
ÒNo, no, my dear Molly,Ó said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that 
he had checked her name with Perc
y before they entered the house. 
ÒI donÕt want to intrude, wouldnÕt
 be here at all if Percy hadnÕt 
wanted to see you al
l so badly. . . .Ó 
ÒOh, Perce!Ó said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss 
him. Ò. . . WeÕve only looked in for five
 minutes, so IÕll have a stroll 
around the yard while you catch up
 with Percy. No, no, I assure 
you I donÕt want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your 
charming garden . . . Ah, that 
young manÕs finished, why doesnÕt 
he take a stroll with me?Ó The atmosphere around the tabl
e changed perceptibly. Every-
body looked from Scrimgeour to 
Harry. Nobody seemed to find 
Scrimgeour s pretense that he di
d not know HarryÕs name convinc-
ing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the 
Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also 
had clean plates. 
ÒYeah, all right,Ó said Harry into the silence. 
He was not fooled; for all Scrimge
ourÕs talk that they had just 
been in the area, that Percy wanted 
to look up his family, this must 
be the real reason that they ha
d come, so that Scrimgeour could 
speak to Harry alone. 
ÒItÕs fine,Ó he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen 
from his chair. ÒFine,Ó he added,
 as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth 
to speak. 
ÒWonderful!Ó said Scrimgeour, st
anding back to let Harry pass

!#(*)&4$)" -;-" through the door ahead of him. ÒWeÕ
ll just take a turn around the 
garden, and Percy and IÕll be
 off. Carry on, everyone!Ó 
Harry walked across the yard towa
rd the WeasleysÕ overgrown, 
snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour li
mping slightly at his side. He 
had, Harry knew, been Head of th
e Auror office; he looked tough 
and battle-scarred, very different fr
om portly Fudge in his bowler 
hat. ÒCharming,Ó said Scrimgeour, st
opping at the garden fence and 
looking out over the snowy lawn 
and the indistinguishable plants. 
ÒCharming.Ó 
Harry said nothing. He could te
ll that Scrimgeo
ur was watching 
him. ÒIÕve wanted to meet you for a ve
ry long time,Ó said Scrimgeour, 
after a few moments. ÒDid you know that?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry truthfully. 
ÒOh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very 
protective of you,Ó said Scrimgeo
ur. ÒNatural, of course, natural, 
after what youÕve been through. 
. . . Especially what happened at 
the Ministry . . .Ó 
He waited for Harry to say some
thing, but Harry did not oblige, 
so he went on, ÒI have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you 
ever since I gained office, bu
t Dumbledore has Ñ most under-
standably, as I say 
Ñ prevented this.Ó 
Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. 
ÒThe rumors that have flown ar
ound!Ó said Scrimgeour. ÒWell, 
of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these 
whispers of a prophecy . . . of 
you being Ôthe Chosen OneÕ. . .Ó 
They were getting near
 it now, Harry though
t, the reason Scrim-
geour was here. 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 -;;" Ò. . . I assume that Dumbledore 
has discussed these matters with 
you?Ó Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. 
He looked at the little gnome prin
ts all around the flowerbeds, and 
the scuffed-up patch that marked 
the spot where Fred had caught 
the gnome now wearing the tutu at
 the top of the Christmas tree. 
Finally, he decided on the 
truth . . . or a bit of it. 
ÒYeah, weÕve discussed it.Ó 
ÒHave you, have you . . .Ó said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out 
of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-
tended to be very interested in
 a gnome that had just poked its 
head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. ÒAnd what has 
Dumbledore told you, Harry?Ó 
ÒSorry, but thatÕs between us,Ó sa
id Harry. He kept his voice as 
pleasant as he could, and Scrimg
eourÕs tone, too, was light and 
friendly as he said, ÒOh, of course, 
if itÕs a question of confidences, 
I wouldnÕt want you to divulge . . 
. no, no . . . and in any case, does 
it really matter whether you ar
e Ôthe Chosen OneÕ or not?Ó 
Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-
sponding. ÒI donÕt really know
 what you mean
, Minister.Ó 
ÒWell, of course, to 
you it will matter enormously,Ó said Scrim-
geour with a laugh. ÒBut to the 
Wizarding community at large . . . 
itÕs all perception, isnÕt it? ItÕs wh
at people believe thatÕs important.Ó 
Harry said nothing. He thought he
 saw, dimly, where they were 
heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The 
gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its 
roots, and Harry kept hi
s eyes fixed upon it. 
ÒPeople believe you 
are Ôthe Chosen One,Õ you see,Ó said Scrim-
geour. ÒThey think you quite the 
hero Ñ which, of course, you 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" -;/" are, Harry, chosen or not! How 
many times have you faced He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? We
ll, anyway,Ó he pressed on, 
without waiting for a reply, Òthe po
int is, you are a symbol of hope 
for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who 
might be able, who might even be 
destined,
 to destroy He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named Ñ we
ll, naturally, it give
s people a lift. And 
I canÕt help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider 
it, well, almost a duty, to stand 
alongside the Ministry, and give 
everyone a boost.Ó 
The gnome had just managed to ge
t hold of a worm. It was now 
tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. 
Harry was silent so long that Sc
rimgeour said, looking from Harry 
to the gnome, ÒFunny little chap
s, arenÕt they? But what say you, 
Harry?Ó 
ÒI donÕt exactly understand what
 you want,Ó said Harry slowly. 
ÒÔStand alongside the MinistryÕ 
. . . What does
 that mean?Ó 
ÒOh, well, nothing at all onerou
s, I assure you,Ó said Scrim-
geour. ÒIf you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry 
from time to time, for instance, 
that would give the right impres-
sion. And of course, while you we
re there, you would have ample 
opportunity to speak to Gawain Ro
bards, my successor as Head of 
the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge
 has told me that you cherish 
an ambition to become an Auror. 
Well, that could be arranged very 
easily. . . .Ó 
Harry felt anger bubbling in the pi
t of his stomach: So Dolores 
Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? 
ÒSo basically,Ó he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few 
points, ÒyouÕd like to give the impression that IÕm working for the 
Ministry?Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 -;5" ÒIt would give everyone a lift to
 think you were more involved, 
Harry,Ó said Scrimgeour, sounding
 relieved that Harry had cot-
toned on so quickly. ÒÔThe Chos
en One,Õ you know . . . ItÕs all 
about giving people hope, the feeli
ng that exciting things are hap-
pening. . . .Ó 
ÒBut if I keep running in and 
out of the Ministry,Ó said Harry, 
still endeavoring to keep his voic
e friendly, ÒwonÕt that seem as 
though I approve of what the MinistryÕs up to?Ó 
ÒWell,Ó said Scrimgeour, frowning
 slightly, Òwell, yes, thatÕs 
partly why weÕd like ÑÓ 
ÒNo, I donÕt think thatÕll work,Ó 
said Harry pleasantly. ÒYou see, 
I donÕt like some of the things 
the MinistryÕs doing. Locking up 
Stan Shunpike, for instance.Ó 
Scrimgeour did not speak for a mo
ment but his expression hard-
ened instantly. ÒI wo
uld not expect you to understand,Ó he said, 
and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as 
Harry had been. ÒThese are danger
ous times, and certain measures 
need to be taken. You 
are sixteen years old ÑÓ 
ÒDumbledoreÕs a lot older than sixteen, and he doesnÕt think 
Stan should be in Azkaban either,Ó
 said Harry. ÒYouÕre making Stan 
a scapegoat, just like you wa
nt to make me a mascot.Ó 
They looked at each other, lo
ng and hard. Finally Scrimgeour 
said, with no pretense at warmth, ÒI see. You prefer Ñ like your 
hero, Dumbledore Ñ to disassociate
 yourself from the Ministry?Ó 
ÒI donÕt want to be
 used,Ó said Harry. 
ÒSome would say itÕs your duty to be used by 
the Ministry!Ó 
ÒYeah, and others might say itÕs 
your duty to check that people 
really are Death Eaters before yo
u chuck them in prison,Ó said 
Harry, his temper rising now. ÒYouÕre doing what Barty Crouch 
$""0'(1""2(3)&1"
!#(*)&4$)" -;6" did. You never get it right, you 
people, do you? Either weÕve got 
Fudge, pretending everythingÕs lo
vely while people get murdered 
right under his nose, or weÕve got you, chucking the wrong people 
into jail and trying to pretend youÕve got Ôthe Chosen OneÕ work-
ing for you!Ó 
ÒSo youÕre not Ôthe Chosen
 OneÕ?Ó said Scrimgeour. 
ÒI thought you said it didnÕt matte
r either way?Ó sa
id Harry, with 
a bitter laugh. ÒNot to you anyway.Ó 
ÒI shouldnÕt have said that,Ó said Scrimgeour quickly. ÒIt was 
tactless ÑÓ 
ÒNo, it was honest,Ó said Harry. 
ÒOne of the only honest things 
youÕve said to me. You donÕt care 
whether I live or die, but you do 
care that I help you convince everyone youÕre winning the war 
against Voldemort. I havenÕt forgotten, Minister. . . .Ó 
He raised his right fist. There, 
shining white on the back of his 
cold hand, were the scars which 
Dolores Umbridge had forced him 
to carve into his own flesh: 
I must not tell lies.
 ÒI donÕt remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying 
to tell everyone Voldemort was ba
ck. The Ministry wasnÕt so keen 
to be pals last year.Ó 
They stood in silence as icy as th
e ground beneath their feet. The 
gnome had finally managed to ex
tricate his worm and was now 
sucking on it happily, leaning agai
nst the bottommost branches of 
the rhododendron bush. 
ÒWhat is Dumbledore up to?Ó 
said Scrimgeour brusquely. 
ÒWhere does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?Ó 
ÒNo idea,Ó said Harry. 
ÒAnd you wouldnÕt tell me if 
you knew,Ó said Scrimgeour, 
Òwould you?Ó 
!#$%&'("")*+&'',"
 -;7" ÒNo, I wouldnÕt,Ó
 said Harry. 
ÒWell, then, I shall have to see 
whether I canÕt find out by other 
means.Ó 
ÒYou can try,Ó said Harry indiffer
ently. ÒBut you seem cleverer 
than Fudge, so IÕd have thought 
youÕd have learned from his mis-
takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed 
heÕs not Minister anymore, but 
DumbledoreÕs still headmaster. IÕd 
leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.Ó 
There was a long pause. 
ÒWell, it is clear to me that 
he has done a very good job on you,Ó 
said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold 
and hard behind his wire-rimmed 
glasses. ÒDumbledoreÕs man through an
d through, arenÕt you, Potter?Ó 
ÒYeah, I am,Ó said Harry. ÒGla
d we straightened that out.Ó 
And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back 
toward the house.

   ate in the afternoon, a few days
 after New Year, Harry, Ron, 
and Ginny lined up beside the ki
tchen fire to return to Hog-
warts. The Ministry had arranged 
this one-off connection to the 
Floo Network to return students qu
ickly and safely to the school. 
Only Mrs. Weasley was there to 
say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, 
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were
 all at work. Mrs. Weasley dis-
solved into tears at the moment of 
parting. Admittedly, it took very 
little to set her off lately; she had 
been crying on and off ever since 
Percy had stormed from the hous
e on Christmas Day with his 
glasses splattered with mashed 
parsnip (for which Fred, George, 
and Ginny all claimed credit). 
ÒDonÕt cry, Mum,Ó said Ginny, pa
tting her on the back as Mrs. 
Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. ÒItÕs okay. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, donÕt worry about us,Ó said
 Ron, permitting his mother 
to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, Òor about Percy. HeÕs such a 
prat, itÕs not really a loss, is it?Ó 
/"!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,67" Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than
 ever as she enfolded Harry in 
her arms. 
ÒPromise me youÕll look after your
self. . . . Stay out of trou-
ble. . . .Ó 
ÒI always do, Mrs. Weasley,Ó said
 Harry. ÒI like 
a quiet life, you 
know me.Ó 
She gave a watery chuckle and sto
od back. ÒBe good, then, all of 
you. . . .Ó 
Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted ÒHogwarts!Ó 
He had one last fleeting view of
 the WeasleysÕ kitchen and Mrs. 
WeasleyÕs tearful face before the 
flames engulfed him; spinning very 
fast, he caught blurred glimpses 
of other Wizarding rooms, which 
were whipped out of sight before 
he could get a proper look; then 
he was slowing down, finally stoppi
ng squarely in the fireplace in 
Professor McGonagallÕs
 office. She barely 
glanced up from her 
work as he clambered out over the grate. 
ÒEvening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.Ó 
ÒNo, Professor.Ó 
Harry straightened his glasses and 
flattened his hair as Ron came 
spinning into view. When Ginny ha
d arrived, all three of them 
trooped out of McGonagallÕs offi
ce and off toward Gryffindor 
Tower. Harry glanced out of the 
corridor windows as they passed; 
the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow 
than had lain over the Burrow gard
en. In the distance, he could see 
Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin. 
ÒBaubles,Ó said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat 
Lady, who was looking rather pale
r than usual and winced at his 
loud voice. 
ÒNo,Ó she said. 
$"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,68" ÒWhat dÕyou mean, ÔnoÕ?Ó 
ÒThere is a new password,Ó she 
said. ÒAnd please donÕt shout.Ó 
ÒBut weÕve been away, howÕre we supposed to Ñ ?Ó 
ÒHarry! Ginny!Ó 
Hermione was hurrying toward th
em, very pink-faced and wear-
ing a cloak, hat, and gloves. 
ÒI got back a couple of hours ago, IÕve just been down to visit 
Hagrid and Buck Ñ I mean Wither
wings,Ó she said breathlessly. 
ÒDid you have a 
good Christmas?Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Ron at once, Òpre
tty eventful, Rufus Scrim ÑÓ 
ÒIÕve got something for you, 
Harry,Ó said Hermione, neither 
looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. ÒOh, 
hang on Ñ password. 
Abstinence.Ó ÒPrecisely,Ó said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung for-
ward to reveal the portrait hole. 
ÒWhatÕs up with her?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒOverindulged over Christmas, 
apparently,Ó said Hermione, 
rolling her eyes as she led the wa
y into the packed common room. 
ÒShe and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine 
in that picture of drunk monk
s down by the Charms corridor. 
Anyway . . .Ó 
She rummaged in her pocket fo
r a moment, then pulled out a 
scroll of parchment with Du
mbledoreÕs writing on it. 
ÒGreat,Ó said Harry, unrolling it at
 once to discover that his next 
lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. 
ÒIÕve got loads to tell him 
Ñ and you. LetÕs sit down ÑÓ 
But at that moment there was a 
loud squeal of ÒWon-Won!Ó and 
Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself 
into RonÕs arms. Several onlook
ers sniggered; Hermione gave a 
!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,69" tinkling laugh and said, ÒThereÕs 
a table over here. . . . Coming, 
Ginny?Ó ÒNo, thanks, I said IÕd meet 
Dean,Ó said Ginny, though Harry 
could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. 
Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in
 a kind of vertical wrestling 
match, Harry led Hermione 
over to the spare table. 
ÒSo how was your Christmas?Ó 
ÒOh, fine,Ó she shrugged. ÒNothin
g special. How was it at Won-
WonÕs?Ó ÒIÕll tell you in a minute,Ó sa
id Harry. ÒLook, Hermione, canÕt 
you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒNo, I canÕt,Ó she said fl
atly. ÒSo donÕt even ask.Ó 
ÒI thought maybe, you kn
ow, over Christmas ÑÓ 
ÒIt was the Fat Lady who drank 
a vat of five-hundred-year-old 
wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted 
to tell me?Ó 
She looked too fierce to argue 
with at that moment, so Harry 
dropped the subject of Ron and reco
unted all that he had overheard 
between Malfoy and Snape. When he
 had finished, Hermione sat in 
thought for a moment and then said, ÒDonÕt you think Ñ ?Ó 
ÒÑ he was pretending to offer he
lp so that he could trick Mal-
foy into telling him what heÕs doing?Ó 
ÒWell, yes,Ó said Hermione. 
ÒRonÕs dad and Lupin think so,Ó Harry said grudgingly. ÒBut 
this definitely proves MalfoyÕs pl
anning something, you canÕt deny 
that.Ó ÒNo, I canÕt,Ó she answered slowly. 
ÒAnd heÕs acting on VoldemortÕ
s orders, just like I said!Ó 
 $"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,6," ÒHmm . . . did either of them actually mention VoldemortÕs 
name?Ó Harry frowned, trying to rememb
er. ÒIÕm not sure . . . Snape 
definitely said Ôyour master,Õ 
and who else wo
uld that be?Ó 
ÒI donÕt know,Ó said Hermione, biting her lip. ÒMaybe his 
father?Ó 
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even 
noticing Lavender tickli
ng Ron. ÒHowÕs Lupin?Ó 
ÒNot great,Ó said Harry, and he told her all about LupinÕs mission 
among the werewolves and the diffic
ulties he was facing. ÒHave you 
heard of this Fenrir Greyback?Ó 
ÒYes, I have!Ó said Hermione, so
unding startled. ÒAnd so have 
you, Harry!Ó 
ÒWhen, History of Magic? You 
know full well
 I never lis-
tened . . .Ó 
ÒNo, no, not History of Magic 
Ñ Malfoy threatened Borgin 
with him!Ó said Hermione. ÒBack in
 Knockturn Alley, donÕt you re-
member? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend 
and that heÕd be checking up on BorginÕs progress!Ó 
Harry gaped at her. ÒI forgot! But this 
proves MalfoyÕs a Death 
Eater, how else could he be in 
contact with Greyback and telling 
him what to do?Ó 
ÒIt is pretty suspicious,Ó breathed Hermione. ÒUnless . . .Ó 
ÒOh, come on,Ó said Harry in ex
asperation, Òyou canÕt get round 
this one!Ó ÒWell . . . there is 
the possibility it was an empty threat.Ó 
ÒYouÕre unbelievable, you are,Ó 
said Harry, shaking his head. 
ÒWeÕll see whoÕs right. 
. . . YouÕll be eating 
your words, Hermione,  
 !#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,6-" just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, 
I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour 
as well. . . .Ó 
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them 
abusing the Minister of Magic, 
for Hermione, like Ron, thought 
that after all the Ministry had pu
t Harry through the previous year, 
they had a great deal of nerv
e asking him for help now. 
The new term started next morning 
with a pleasant surprise for 
the sixth years: a large sign had 
been pinned to the common room 
notice boards overnight. 
 !""!#$%$&'()*++&'+(
If you are seventeen years of ag
e, or will turn seventeen on 
or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a 
twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Min-
istry of Magic Apparition inst
ructor. Please sign below if 
you would like to particip
ate. Cost: 12 Galleons. 
 Harry and Ron joined the crowd th
at was jostling around the 
notice and taking it in turns to
 write their names at the bottom. 
Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when 
Lavender crept up behind him, sli
pped her hands over his eyes, and 
trilled, ÒGuess who, Won-Won?
Ó Harry turned to see Hermione 
stalking off; he caught up with he
r, having no wish to stay behind 
with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with 
them only a little way beyond the 
portrait hole, his ears bright red 
and his expression di
sgruntled. Without a 
word, Hermione sped 
up to walk with Neville. 
ÒSo Ñ Apparition,Ó said Ron, his 
tone making it 
perfectly plain  
 $"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,66" that Harry was not to mention wh
at had just ha
ppened. ÒShould 
be a laugh, eh?Ó 
ÒI dunno,Ó said Harry. ÒMaybe 
itÕs better when you do it your-
self, I didnÕt enjoy it much wh
en Dumbledore took me along for 
the ride.Ó 
ÒI forgot youÕd already done it. . . . IÕd better pass my test first 
time,Ó said Ron, looking anxi
ous. ÒFred and 
George did.Ó 
ÒCharlie failed, th
ough, didnÕt he?Ó 
ÒYeah, but CharlieÕs bigger than
 meÓ Ñ Ron held his arms out 
from his body as though he was 
a gorilla Ñ Òso Fred and George 
didnÕt go on about it much . . 
. not to his face anyway . . .Ó 
ÒWhen can we take the actual test?Ó 
ÒSoon as weÕre seventeen. ThatÕs only March for me!Ó 
ÒYeah, but you wouldnÕt be able 
to Apparate in here, not in the 
castle . . .Ó 
ÒNot the point, is it? Everyone would know I 
could Apparate if I 
wanted.Ó Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Ap-
parition. All that day there was 
much talk about the forthcoming 
lessons; a great deal of store was 
set by being able to vanish and 
reappear at will. 
ÒHow cool will it be when we 
can just ÑÓ Seamus clicked his 
fingers to indicate disappearance. ÒM
e cousin Fergus does it just to 
annoy me, you wait till I can do it
 back . . . HeÕll never have an-
other peaceful moment. . . .Ó 
Lost in visions of th
is happy prospect, he 
flicked his wand a lit-
tle too enthusiastically, so that in
stead of producing the fountain of 
pure water that was the object of 
todayÕs Charms lesson, he let out  
 !#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,6:" a hoselike jet that ricocheted o
ff the ceiling and knocked Professor 
Flitwick flat on his face. 
ÒHarryÕs already Apparated,Ó Ron told a slightly abashed Sea-
mus, after Professor Flitwick had 
dried himself off 
with a wave of 
his wand and set Seamus lines: Ò
I am a wizard, not a baboon bran-
dishing a stick.
Ó ÒDum Ñ er Ñ someone 
took him. Side-Along-
Apparition, you know.Ó 
ÒWhoa!Ó whispered Seamus, and he
, Dean, and Neville put their 
heads a little closer to hear what 
Apparition felt like. For the rest of 
the day, Harry was besieged with
 requests from the other sixth 
years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed 
awed, rather than put off, when 
he told them how uncomfortable 
it was, and he was still answering 
detailed questions at ten to eight 
that evening, when he was forced to
 lie and say that he needed to 
return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson 
with Dumbledore. 
The lamps in DumbledoreÕs office 
were lit, the portraits of pre-
vious headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pen-
sieve was ready upon the desk on
ce more. DumbledoreÕs hands lay 
on either side of it, the right o
ne as blackened and burnt-looking as 
ever. It did not seem to have he
aled at all and Harry wondered, for 
perhaps the hundredth time, what ha
d caused such a distinctive in-
jury, but did not ask;
 Dumbledore had said 
that he would know 
eventually and there was, in any ca
se, another subject he wanted to 
discuss. But before Harry could 
say anything about Snape and 
Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke. 
ÒI hear that you met the Minist
er of Magic over Christmas?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry. ÒHeÕs 
not very happ
y with me.Ó 
 $"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,6;" ÒNo,Ó sighed Dumbledore. ÒHe 
is not very happy with me 
either. We must try not to sink
 beneath our anguish, Harry, but 
battle on.Ó 
Harry grinned. 
ÒHe wanted me to tell the Wi
zarding community that the Min-
istryÕs doing a wonderful job.Ó 
Dumbledore smiled. 
ÒIt was FudgeÕs idea originally, yo
u know. During his
 last days in 
office, when he was trying desper
ately to cling to his post, he 
sought a meeting with you, hoping
 that you would give him your 
support ÑÓ 
ÒAfter everything Fudge did last year?Ó said Harry angrily. ÒAfter 
Umbridge?Ó ÒI told Cornelius there was no ch
ance of it, but the idea did not 
die when he left office. Within hours of ScrimgeourÕs appointment 
we met and he demanded that I 
arrange a meeting with you ÑÓ 
ÒSo thatÕs why you argued!Ó Har
ry blurted out. ÒIt was in the 
Daily Prophet.
Ó ÒThe Prophet
 is bound to report the truth occasionally,Ó said 
Dumbledore, Òif only accidentally
. Yes, that was why we argued. 
Well, it appears that 
Rufus found a way to corner you at last.Ó 
ÒHe accused me of being ÔDumbledoreÕs man through and 
through.ÕÓ 
ÒHow very rude of him.Ó 
ÒI told him I was.Ó 
Dumbledore opened his mouth to
 speak and then closed it 
again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the ph
oenix let out a low, soft, musi-
cal cry. To HarryÕs in
tense embarrassment, he suddenly realized  
 !#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,6<" that DumbledoreÕs bright blue 
eyes looked rather watery, and 
stared hastily at hi
s own knees. When Du
mbledore spoke, how-
ever, his voice was quite steady. 
ÒI am very touched, Harry.Ó 
ÒScrimgeour wanted to know where you go when youÕre not at 
Hogwarts,Ó said Harry, still 
looking fixedly at his knees. 
ÒYes, he is very nosy about that
,Ó said Dumbledore, now sound-
ing cheerful, and Harry thought it 
safe to look up again. ÒHe has 
even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set 
Dawlish to tail me. It 
wasnÕt kind. I have alre
ady been forced to jinx 
Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.Ó 
ÒSo they still donÕt know where 
you go?Ó asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intr
iguing subject, but Dumbledore 
merely smiled over the top 
of his half-moon spectacles. 
ÒNo, they donÕt, and the time is not quite right for you to know 
either. Now, I suggest we press on
, unless thereÕs anything else Ñ ?Ó 
ÒThere is, actually, sir,Ó said
 Harry. ÒItÕs about Malfoy and 
Snape.Ó 
ÒProfessor
 Snape, Harry.Ó 
ÒYes, sir. I overheard them during
 Professor SlughornÕs party . . . 
well, I followed them
, actually. . . .Ó 
Dumbledore listened to HarryÕs st
ory with an impassive face. 
When Harry had finished he di
d not speak for 
a few moments, 
then said, ÒThank you for telling me
 this, Harry, but I suggest that 
you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great 
importance.Ó 
ÒNot of great importance?Ó repe
ated Harry incredulously. ÒPro-
fessor, did you understand Ñ ?Ó ÒYes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I 
$"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,6." understood everything you told me
,Ó said Dumbledore, a little 
sharply. ÒI think you might even co
nsider the possibility that I un-
derstood more than you did. Again,
 I am glad that you have con-
fided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me 
anything that causes me disquiet.Ó 
Harry sat in seething silence, gl
aring at Dumbledore. What was 
going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered 
Snape to find out what Malfoy 
was doing, in which case he had 
already heard everything Harry had 
just told him from Snape? Or 
was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not 
to be? 
ÒSo, sir,Ó said Harry, in what he
 hoped was a polite, calm voice, 
Òyou definitely 
still trust Ñ ?Ó 
ÒI have been tolerant enough to
 answer that question already,Ó 
said Dumbledore, but he did no
t sound very tolerant anymore. 
ÒMy answer has 
not changed.Ó 
ÒI should think not,Ó said a snid
e voice; Phineas Nigellus was ev-
idently only pretending to be 
asleep. Dumbledore ignored him. 
ÒAnd now, Harry, I must insist th
at we press on. I have more im-
portant things to discuss with you this evening.Ó 
Harry sat there feeling mutinous. Ho
w would it be if he refused 
to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case 
against Malfoy? As though he had read HarryÕs mind, Dumbledore 
shook his head. 
ÒAh, Harry, how often this happe
ns, even between
 the best of 
friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more 
important than anything the othe
r might have to contribute!Ó 
ÒI donÕt think what youÕve got to
 say is unimport
ant, sir,Ó said 
Harry stiffly. 
!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,:7" ÒWell, you are quite right, because it is not,Ó said Dumbledore 
briskly. ÒI have two more memories
 to show you this evening, both 
obtained with enormous difficulty,
 and the second of them is, I 
think, the most import
ant I have collected.Ó 
Harry did not say anything to this; 
he still felt an
gry at the re-
ception his confidences had received
, but could not see what was to 
be gained by arguing further. 
ÒSo,Ó said Dumbledore, in a ring
ing voice, Òwe meet this eve-
ning to continue the ta
le of Tom Riddle, whom
 we left last lesson 
poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remem-
ber how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused 
my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned 
him against continued thievery 
when he arrived at school. 
ÒWell, the start of the school ye
ar arrived and with it came Tom 
Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the 
other first years to be sorted. He 
was placed in Slytherin House al-
most the moment that the Sortin
g Hat touched his head,Ó contin-
ued Dumbledore, waving his black
ened hand toward the shelf over 
his head where the Sorting Hat sa
t, ancient and unmoving. ÒHow 
soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could 
talk to snakes, I do not know Ñ perhaps that very evening. The 
knowledge can only have excited 
him and increase
d his sense of 
self-importance. 
ÒHowever, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins 
with displays of Parseltongue in 
their common room, no hint of it 
reached the staff. He showed no 
sign of outward arrogance or ag-
gression at all. As an unusuall
y talented and very good-looking or-
phan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff 
almost from the moment of his a
rrival. He seemed polite, quiet, 
$"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,:8" and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly
 all were most favorably im-
pressed by him.Ó 
ÒDidnÕt you tell them, sir, what 
heÕd been like when you met him 
at the orphanage?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒNo, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was 
possible that he felt sorry for ho
w he had behaved before and was 
resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. 
I chose to give him that chance.Ó 
Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had 
opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was DumbledoreÕs ten-
dency to trust people in spite of
 overwhelming evidence that they 
did not deserve it! But then Harr
y remembered something. . . . 
ÒBut you didnÕt 
really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the 
Riddle who came out of that 
diary said, ÔDumbledore never 
seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.ÕÓ 
ÒLet us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trust-
worthy,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI had, 
as I have already indicated, re-
solved to keep a close eye upon hi
m, and so I did. I cannot pretend 
that I gleaned a great deal from my
 observations at first. He was 
very guarded with me; he felt, I am 
sure, that in the thrill of dis-
covering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was 
careful never to reveal as much ag
ain, but he could not take back 
what he had let slip in his excite
ment, nor what Mrs. Cole had con-
fided in me. However, he had the 
sense never to try and charm me 
as he charmed so many of my colleagues. 
ÒAs he moved up the school, he
 gathered about him a group 
of dedicated friends; I call them
 that, for want of a better term, 
although as I have already indica
ted, Riddle undoubtedly felt no 
affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour 
within the castle. They were a mo
tley collection; a mixture of the 
!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,:9" weak seeking protection, the ambiti
ous seeking some shared glory, 
and the thuggish gravitating toward
 a leader who could show them 
more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the fore-
runners of the Death Eaters, and in
deed some of them became the 
first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts. 
ÒRigidly controlled by Riddle, th
ey were never detected in open 
wrongdoing, although their seven 
years at Hogwarts were marked 
by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfac-
torily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening 
of the Chamber of Secrets, which re
sulted in the death of a girl. As 
you know, Hagrid was wrongl
y accused of that crime. ÒI have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hog-
warts,Ó said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pen-
sieve. ÒFew who knew him then ar
e prepared to talk about him; 
they are too terrified. What I know
, I found out after he had left 
Hogwarts, after much painstakin
g effort, after tracing those few 
who could be tricked into speaking
, after searching old records and 
questioning Muggle and wi
zard witnesses alike. 
ÒThose whom I could persuade to
 talk told me that Riddle was 
obsessed with his parent
age. This is understandable, of course; he 
had grown up in an orphanage an
d naturally wished to know how 
he came to be there. It seems that 
he searched in vain for some trace 
of Tom Riddle senior on
 the shields in the 
trophy room, on the 
lists of prefects in th
e old school records, ev
en in the books of Wiz-
arding history. Finally he was forc
ed to accept that his father had 
never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he 
dropped the name forever, assume
d the identity of Lord Volde-
mort, and began his investigations into his previously despised  
 $"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,:," motherÕs family Ñ the woman wh
om, you will remember, he had 
thought could not be 
a witch if she had su
ccumbed to the shame-
ful human weakne
ss of death. 
ÒAll he had to go upon was the single name ÔMarvolo,Õ which he 
knew from those who ran the orph
anage had been his motherÕs fa-
therÕs name. Finally, after painst
aking research th
rough old books 
of Wizarding families, he discover
ed the existence of SlytherinÕs 
surviving line. In the summer of his
 sixteenth year, he left the or-
phanage to which he re
turned annually and 
set off to find his 
Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry
, if you will stand . . .Ó 
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a 
small crystal bottle filled wi
th swirling, pearly memory. 
ÒI was very lucky to collect this
,Ó he said, as he poured the 
gleaming mass into the Pensieve. 
ÒAs you will understand when we 
have experienced 
it. Shall we?Ó 
Harry stepped up to the stone ba
sin and bowed obediently until 
his face sank through the surface 
of the memory; he felt the famil-
iar sensation of falling through no
thingness and then
 landed upon 
a dirty stone floor in 
almost total darkness. 
It took him several seconds to re
cognize the place, by which time 
Dumbledore had landed beside him. The GauntsÕ house was now 
more indescribably filthy than an
ywhere Harry had ever seen. The 
ceiling was thick with cobwebs, th
e floor coated in grime; moldy 
and rotting food lay upon the tabl
e amidst a mass of crusted pots. 
The only light came fr
om a single guttering candle placed at the 
feet of a man with hair and be
ard so overgrown Harry could see 
neither eyes nor mouth. He was 
slumped in an armchair by the 
fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But  
 !#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,:-" then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked 
awake, raising a wand in his righ
t hand and a short knife in his 
left. 
The door creaked open. There on 
the threshold, holding an old-
fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry re
cognized at once: tall, pale, 
dark-haired, and handsome 
Ñ the teenage Voldemort. 
VoldemortÕs eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found 
the man in the armchair. For a fe
w seconds they looked at each 
other, then the man staggered upri
ght, the many empty bottles at 
his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor. 
ÒYOU!Ó he bellowed. ÒYOU!Ó 
And he hurtled drunkenly at Ridd
le, wand and knife held aloft. 
ÒStop.
Ó Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, 
sending moldy pots crashing to 
the floor. He stared at Riddle. 
There was a long silence while they
 contemplated each other. The 
man broke it. 
ÒYou speak it
?Ó ÒYes, I speak it,
Ó said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, 
allowing the door to swing shut 
behind him. Harry could not help 
but feel a resentful admiration fo
r VoldemortÕs complete lack of 
fear. His face merely expressed 
disgust and, perhaps, disappoint-
ment. 
ÒWhere is Marvolo
?Ó he asked. 
ÒDead,Ó said the other. Ò
Died years ago, didnÕt he
?Ó Riddle frowned. 
ÒWho are you, then
?Ó ÒIÕm Morfin, ainÕt I
?Ó  $"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,:6" ÒMarvoloÕs son
?Ó ÒÕCourse I am, then
 . . .Ó 
Morfin pushed the hair out of his
 dirty face, the better to see 
Riddle, and Harry saw th
at he wore MarvoloÕs 
black-stoned ring on 
his right hand. 
ÒI thought you was that Muggle,
Ó whispered Morfin. Ò
You look 
mighty like that Muggle.
Ó ÒWhat Muggle
?Ó said Riddle sharply. 
ÒThat Muggle what my sister took 
a fancy to, that Muggle what lives 
in the big house over the way,
Ó said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly 
upon the floor between them. Ò
You look right like him. Riddle. But 
heÕs older now, in Õe? HeÕs ol
derÕn you, now I think on it.
 . . .Ó 
Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching 
the edge of the table for support. Ò
He come back, see,
Ó he added 
stupidly. 
Voldemort was gazing at Morfin 
as though appraising his possi-
bilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, Ò
Riddle came back
?Ó ÒAr, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth
!Ó said Morfin, 
spitting on the floor again. Ò
Robbed us, mind, before she ran off! 
WhereÕs the locket, eh, whereÕs SlytherinÕs locket
?Ó Voldemort did not answer. Morfin
 was working himself into a 
rage again; he brandished
 his knife and shouted, Ò
Dishonored us, 
she did, that little slut! And whoÕre 
you, coming here and asking ques-
tions about all that? ItÕs over, innit. . . . ItÕs over.
 . . .Ó 
He looked away, staggering sl
ightly, and Voldemort moved for-
ward. As he did so, an unnatural 
darkness fell, extinguishing Volde-
mortÕs lamp and MorfinÕs candle
, extinguishing ev
erything. . . . 
DumbledoreÕs fingers closed ti
ghtly around HarryÕs arm and  
 !#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,::" they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light 
in DumbledoreÕs office seemed to 
dazzle HarryÕs eyes after that im-
penetrable darkness. 
ÒIs that all?Ó said Harry at once. ÒWhy did it go dark, what hap-
pened?Ó 
ÒBecause Morfin could not remember anything from that point 
onward,Ó said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. 
ÒWhen he awoke next morning, he
 was lying on the floor, quite 
alone. MarvoloÕs 
ring had gone. 
ÒMeanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was run-
ning along the High Street, scream
ing that there were three bodies 
lying in the drawing room of the 
big house: Tom Riddle Senior and 
his mother and father. 
ÒThe Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, 
they do not know to this day 
how the Riddles died, for the 
Avada 
Kedavra curse does not usually leave an
y sign of damage. . . . The 
exception sits before me,Ó Du
mbledore added, with a nod to 
HarryÕs scar. ÒThe Ministry, on the 
other hand, knew at once that 
this was a wizardÕs murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-
hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater 
who had already been imprisoned 
once for attacking one of the 
murdered people. 
ÒSo the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to 
question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to 
the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could 
know. He was proud, he said, to 
have killed the Muggles, had been 
awaiting his chance all these ye
ars. He handed 
over his wand, 
which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. 
And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. 
$"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,:;" All that disturbed him was the fact that his fatherÕs ring had disap-
peared. ÔHeÕll kill me for losing it,Õ 
he told his captors over and over 
again. ÔHeÕll kill me for losing 
his ring.Õ And that
, apparently, was 
all he ever said again. He lived ou
t the remainder of his life in Azka-
ban, lamenting the loss of MarvoloÕ
s last heirloom, and is buried 
beside the prison, alongside the ot
her poor souls who have expired 
within its walls.Ó 
ÒSo Voldemort stole MorfinÕs wand
 and used it?Ó said Harry, sit-
ting up straight. 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Dumbledore.
 ÒWe have no memories to 
show us this, but I think we ca
n be fairly sure what happened. 
Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded 
across the valley to Ôthe
 big house over the wayÕ There he murdered 
the Muggle man who had abandoned
 his witch mother, and, for 
good measure, his Muggle 
grandparents, thus ob
literating the last 
of the unworthy Riddle line and re
venging himself upon the father 
who never wanted him. Then he re
turned to the Gaunt hovel, per-
formed the complex bi
t of magic that would implant a false mem-
ory in his uncleÕs mind, laid MorfinÕs wand beside its unconscious 
owner, pocketed the ancient ri
ng he wore, and departed.Ó 
ÒAnd Morfin never realized
 he hadnÕt done it?Ó 
ÒNever,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒHe gave, as I say, a full and boastful 
confession.Ó 
ÒBut he had this real memory in him all the time!Ó 
ÒYes, but it took a great deal of 
skilled Legilimency to coax it out 
of him,Ó said Dumbledore, Òand wh
y should anybody delve further 
into MorfinÕs mind when he had already confessed to the crime? 
However, I was able to secure a visi
t to Morfin in the last weeks of 
his life, by which time I was attemp
ting to discover as much as I 
!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,:<" could about VoldemortÕs past. I extracted this memory with diffi-
culty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure 
MorfinÕs release from Azkaban. 
Before the Ministry reached their 
decision, however, Morfin had died.Ó 
ÒBut how come the Ministry didn
Õt realize that Voldemort had 
done all that to Morfin?Ó Harry as
ked angrily. ÒHe was underage at 
the time, wasnÕt he? I thought they could detect underage magic!Ó 
ÒYou are quite right Ñ they can 
detect magic, but not the per-
petrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry 
for the Hover Charm that wa
s, in fact, cast by ÑÓ 
ÒDobby,Ó growled Harry; this injust
ice still rankled. ÒSo if youÕre 
underage and you do magic inside an
 adult witch or wizardÕs house, 
the Ministry wonÕt know?Ó 
ÒThey will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,Ó 
said Dumbledore, smiling slightly 
at the look of great indignation 
on HarryÕs face. ÒThey rely on wi
tch and wizard parents to enforce 
their offspringÕs obedience 
while within 
their walls.Ó 
ÒWell, thatÕs rubbish,Ó snap
ped Harry. ÒLook what happened 
here, look what happened to Morfin!Ó 
ÒI agree,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWhatever Morfin was, he did not 
deserve to die as he did, blam
ed for murders he had not commit-
ted. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory 
before we part. . . .Ó 
Dumbledore took from an inside
 pocket another crystal phial 
and Harry fell silent at once, re
membering that Dumbledore had 
said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed 
that the contents proved difficult
 to empty into the Pensieve, as 
though they had congealed slig
htly; did memories go bad? 
ÒThis will not take long,Ó said Dumbledore, when he had finally 
$"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,:." emptied the phial. ÒWe shall be 
back before you know it. Once 
more into the Pensieve, then . . .Ó 
And Harry fell again through the silv
er surface, landing this time 
right in front of
 a man he recognized at once. 
It was a much younger Horace 
Slughorn. Harry was so used to 
him bald that he found the sight 
of Slughorn with thick, shiny, 
straw-colored hair quite disconcertin
g; it looked as though he had 
had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-
sized bald patch on his crown. Hi
s mustache, less massive than it 
was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as 
the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly 
embroidered waistcoat were taking 
a fair amount of strain. His lit-
tle feet resting upon a velvet pouffe
, he was sitting well back in a 
comfortable winged armchair, one 
hand grasping a small glass of 
wine, the other searchin
g through a box of cr
ystalized pineapple. 
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and 
saw that they were stan
ding in SlughornÕs of
fice. Half a dozen boys 
were sitting around Slughorn, all on
 harder or lower seats than his, 
and all in their mid-teens. Har
ry recognized Vold
emort at once. 
His was the most handsome face an
d he looked the most relaxed of 
all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his 
chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that
 he was wearing MarvoloÕs gold-
and-black ring; he had al
ready killed his father. 
ÒSir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?Ó he asked. 
ÒTom, Tom, if I knew I couldnÕt
 tell you,Ó said Slughorn, wag-
ging a reproving, sugar-covered fi
nger at Riddle, though ruining 
the effect slightly by winking. ÒI 
must say, IÕd like to know where 
you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the 
staff, you are.Ó 
!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,;7" Riddle smiled; the other boys la
ughed and cast him admiring 
looks. 
ÒWhat with your uncanny ability 
to know things you shouldnÕt, 
and your careful flattery of the 
people who matter Ñ thank you for 
the pineapple, by 
the way, youÕre quite right,
 it is my favorite ÑÓ 
As several of the boys titt
ered, something very odd happened. 
The whole room was suddenly filled 
with a thick white fog, so that 
Harry could see nothing but the 
face of Dumbledore, who was 
standing beside him. Then SlughornÕs voice rang out through the 
mist, unnaturally loudly, Ò
YouÕll go wrong, boy, mark my words.
Ó The fog cleared as suddenly as it
 had appeared and yet nobody 
made any allusion to it, nor did 
anybody look as though anything 
unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a 
small golden clock standing upon
 SlughornÕs desk chimed eleven 
oÕclock. ÒGood gracious, is it that time 
already?Ó said Slughorn. ÒYouÕd 
better get going, boys, or weÕll all 
be in trouble. Lestrange, I want 
your essay by tomorrow or itÕs detention. Same goes for you, Avery.Ó 
Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his 
empty glass over to his desk as th
e boys filed out. Voldemort, how-
ever, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, 
wanting to be last in 
the room with Slughorn. ÒLook sharp, Tom,Ó said Slughorn, turning around and finding 
him still present. ÒYou donÕt want 
to be caught out of bed out of 
hours, and you a prefect . . .Ó 
ÒSir, I wanted to ask you something.Ó 
ÒAsk away, then, mÕboy, ask away. . . .Ó 
ÒSir, I wondered what you know
 about . . . ab
out Horcruxes?Ó 
And it happened all over again:
 The dense fog filled the room 
$"")/0112)#""3'34(5"
 ,;8" so that Harry could not see Slugho
rn or Voldemort at all; only 
Dumbledore, smiling serenely besi
de him. Then SlughornÕs voice 
boomed out again, just 
as it had done before. 
ÒI donÕt know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldnÕt tell you if I 
did! Now get out of here at once and donÕt let me catch you mentioning 
them again
!Ó ÒWell, thatÕs that,Ó said Du
mbledore placidly beside Harry. 
ÒTime to go.Ó 
And HarryÕs feet left the floor to fa
ll, seconds later, back onto the 
rug in front of 
DumbledoreÕs desk. 
ÒThatÕs all there is?Ó said Harry blankly. 
Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory 
of all, but he could not see what
 was so significant about it. Ad-
mittedly the fog, and the fact that
 nobody seemed to have noticed 
it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened 
except that Voldemort had asked a 
question and failed to get an 
answer. 
ÒAs you might have noticed,Ó sa
id Dumbledore, reseating him-
self behind his desk, Òthat memo
ry has been tampered with.Ó 
ÒTampered with?Ó repe
ated Harry, sittin
g back down too. 
ÒCertainly,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒProfessor Slughorn has meddled 
with his own recollections.Ó 
ÒBut why would 
he do that?Ó 
ÒBecause, I think, he is ashame
d of what he remembers,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒHe has tried to rework the memory to show himself 
in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me 
to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is 
all to the good, for it shows that 
the true memory is still there be-
neath the alterations. 
!#$%&'("")'*'+&''+"
 ,;9" ÒAnd so, for the first time, I am
 giving you homework, Harry. It 
will be your job to persuade Prof
essor Slughorn to divulge the real 
memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of in-
formation of all.Ó 
Harry stared at him. 
ÒBut surely, sir,Ó he said, keepin
g his voice as respectful as pos-
sible, Òyou donÕt need me Ñ you could use Legilimency . . . or 
Veritaserum. . . .Ó 
ÒProfessor Slughorn is an extremel
y able wizard who will be ex-
pecting both,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒHe is much more accomplished 
at Occlumency than poor Morfin
 Gaunt, and I 
would be aston-
ished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever 
since I coerced him into giving me 
this travesty of a recollection. 
ÒNo, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth 
from Professor Slughorn by forc
e, and might do much more harm 
than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has 
his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one 
person who might be able to penetr
ate his defenses. It is most im-
portant that we secure the true
 memory, Harry. . . . How impor-
tant, we will only know when we 
have seen the real thing. So, good 
luck . . . and good night.Ó 
A little taken ab
ack by the abrupt dismi
ssal, Harry got to his feet 
quickly. ÒGood night, sir.Ó 
As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard 
Phineas Nigellus say, ÒI canÕt see why the boy should be able to do 
it better than you, Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒI wouldnÕt expect you to, Phineas,Ó replied Dumbledore, and 
Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.

   he next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione 
the task that Dumbledore had 
set him, though
 separately, 
for Hermione still refused to remain
 in RonÕs presence longer than 
it took to give him a contemptuous look. 
Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with 
Slughorn at all. 
ÒHe loves you,Ó he said over breakf
ast, waving an airy forkful of 
fried egg. ÒWonÕt refuse you anythi
ng, will he? Not his little Potions 
Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.Ó 
Hermione, however, took a gloom
ier view. ÒHe must be deter-
mined to hide what really happene
d if Dumbledore couldnÕt get it 
out of him,Ó she said in a low voic
e, as they stood in the deserted, 
snowy courtyard at break. ÒHorcruxes . . . 
Horcruxes . . . IÕve never 
even heard of them. . . .Ó 
ÒYou havenÕt?Ó Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that  
 &"!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,-3" Hermione might have been able to 
give him a clue as to what Hor-
cruxes were. 
ÒThey must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would 
Voldemort have wanted to know 
about them? I think itÕs going 
to be difficult to get the informatio
n, Harry, youÕll 
have to be very 
careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strat-
egy. . . .Ó 
ÒRon reckons I should just hang back after Potions this after-
noon. . . .Ó 
ÒOh, well, if 
Won-Won
 thinks that, youÕd better do it,Ó she said, 
flaring up at once. ÒAfter all, when has 
Won-WonÕs
 judgment ever 
been faulty?Ó 
ÒHermione, canÕt you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒNo!Ó she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone 
and ankle-deep in snow. 
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to 
share a desk. Today, Hermione 
moved her cauldron around the table 
so that she was close to Ernie, 
and ignored both Harry and Ron. 
ÒWhatÕve you done?Ó Ron muttered to 
Harry, looking at Hermi-
oneÕs haughty profile. 
But before Harry could answer, Sl
ughorn was calling for silence 
from the front 
of the room. 
ÒSettle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to 
get through this afternoon! Golpalo
ttÕs Third Law . . . who can tell 
me Ñ ? But Miss 
Granger can, of course!Ó 
Hermione recited at top speed:

.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,-4" ÒPrecisely!Ó beamed Slughorn. ÒTen points for Gryffindor! Now,

Third Law as true . . .Ó 
Harry was going to have to take Sl
ughornÕs word for it that Gol-
palottÕs Third Law was true, beca
use he had not understood any of 
it. Nobody apart from Hermione 
seemed to be following what 
Slughorn said next either. 
Ò. . . which means, of course, 
that assuming we have achieved 
correct identification of the potion
Õs ingredients by ScarpinÕs Revel-
aspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting 
antidotes to those ingredients in an
d of themselves, but to find that 
added component that will, by an 
almost alchemical process, trans-
form these disparate elements ÑÓ 
Ron was sitting beside Harry 
with his mouth half open, doo-
dling absently on his new copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 Ron 
kept forgetting that he
 could no longer rely
 on Hermione to help 
him out of trouble when he fail
ed to grasp what was going on. 
Ò. . . and so,Ó finished Slughorn
, ÒI want each of you to come 
and take one of these phials from 
my desk. You are to create an an-
tidote for the poison within it be
fore the end of the lesson. Good 
luck, and donÕt forget your protective gloves!Ó 
Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward SlughornÕs 
desk before the rest of the class 
had realized it was time to move, 
and by the time Harry, Ron, and Er
nie returned to 
the table, she 
had already tipped the contents of
 her phial into her cauldron and 
was kindling a fire underneath it. 
ÒItÕs a shame that the Prince wonÕt be able to help you much 
with this, Harry,Ó she said brightly
 as she straightened up. ÒYou 
have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts 
or cheats!Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,-5" Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slug-
hornÕs desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his 
cauldron, and lit a fire underneath 
it. He did not have the faintest 
idea what he was supposed to do nex
t. He glanced around at Ron, 
who was now standing there look
ing rather gormless, having 
copied everything
 Harry had done. 
ÒYou sure the Prince hasnÕt got any tips?Ó Ron muttered to 
Harry. Harry pulled out his trusty copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 and 
turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was GolpalottÕs Third 
Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a 
single illuminating note in the Pr
inceÕs hand to explain what it 
meant. Apparently th
e Prince, like Hermio
ne, had had no diffi-
culty understanding it. 
ÒNothing,Ó said Harry gloomily. 
Hermione was now waving her wa
nd enthusiastically over her 
cauldron. Unfortunately, they co
uld not copy the spell she was do-
ing because she was now so good at 
nonverbal incantations that she 
did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, 
was muttering, Ò
Specialis Revelio
!Ó over his cauldron, which sounded 
impressive, so Har
ry and Ron hastened to imitate him. 
It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as 
the best potion-maker in the cl
ass was crashing around his ears. 
Slughorn had peered hopefully into 
his cauldron on his first circuit 
of the dungeon, preparing to exclai
m in delight as he usually did, 
and instead had withdrawn his head 
hastily, coughing, as the smell 
of bad eggs overwhelmed him. He
rmioneÕs expression could not 
have been any smugger; she had 
loathed being outperformed in 
every Potions class. She was now 
decanting the mysteriously sepa-
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,--" rated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. 
More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, 
Harry bent over the Half-Blood Pr
inceÕs book and turned a few 
pages with unnecessary force. 
And there it was, scrawled right 
across a long list of antidotes: 
!"#$%#&'()%*%+),'*-%.'/0%$&)1-%$&-'*$#2%
Harry stared at these words for a moment. HadnÕt he once, long 
ago, heard of bezoars? HadnÕt Sn
ape mentioned them in their first-
ever Potions lesson? Ò
A stone taken from the st
omach of a goat, which 
will protect from most poisons.
Ó It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape 
still been their teacher, Harry woul
d not have dared do it, but this 
was a moment for desperate meas
ures. He hastened toward the 
store cupboard and rummaged wi
thin it, pushing aside unicorn 
horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a 
small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word 
bezoars. He opened the box just as Slughorn called, ÒTwo minutes left, 
everyone!Ó Inside were half a do
zen shriveled brown objects, look-
ing more like dried-up kidneys than
 real stones. Harry seized one, 
put the box back in 
the cupboard, and hu
rried back to his 
cauldron. 
ÒTimeÕs . . . UP!Ó called Slughorn genially. ÒWell, letÕs see how 
youÕve done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?Ó 
Slowly, Slughorn moved around 
the room, examining the vari-
ous antidotes. Nobody had finished
 the task, although Hermione 
was trying to cram a 
few more ingredients into her bottle before 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,-6" Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was 
merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from 
his cauldron. Harry stood there waitin
g, the bezoar clutched in a 
slightly sweaty hand. 
Slughorn reached their table last
. He sniffed ErnieÕs potion and 
passed on to RonÕs with a grimace.
 He did not linger over RonÕs 
cauldron, but backed away 
swiftly, retching slightly. 
ÒAnd you, Harry,Ó he said. ÒWha
t have you got to show me?Ó 
Harry held out his hand, the 
bezoar sitting on his palm. 
Slughorn looked down at it fo
r a full ten seconds. Harry won-
dered, for a moment, whether he 
was going to shout at him. Then 
he threw back his head an
d roared with laughter. 
ÒYouÕve got nerve, boy!Ó he boomed
, taking the bezoar and hold-
ing it up so that the class could s
ee it. ÒOh, youÕre like your mother. 
. . . Well, I canÕt fault you. . . . 
A bezoar would certainly act as an 
antidote to all these potions!Ó 
Hermione, who was sweaty-faced
 and had soot on her nose, 
looked livid. Her half-finished an
tidote, comprising fifty-two in-
gredients, including a chunk of 
her own hair, bubbled sluggishly 
behind Slughorn, who had eyes
 for nobody but Harry. 
ÒAnd you thought of a bezoar al
l by yourself, did you, Harry?Ó 
she asked through gritted teeth. 
ÒThatÕs the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!Ó said 
Slughorn happily, before Harry coul
d reply. ÒJust like his mother, 
she had the same intuitive grasp 
of potion-making, itÕs undoubt-
edly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes,
 Harry, yes, if youÕve got a bezoar 
to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they 
donÕt work on everything, and are pr
etty rare, itÕs still worth know-
ing how to mix antidotes. . . .Ó 
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,-7" The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione 
was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased 
to see, had spilled something 
that looked like cat-sick over him
self. Before either of them could 
express their fury that
 Harry had come top of
 the class by not do-
ing any work, howeve
r, the bell rang. 
ÒTime to pack up!Ó said Slughorn
. ÒAnd an extra ten points to 
Gryffindor for sheer cheek!Ó 
Still chuckling, he waddled back 
to his desk at the front of the 
dungeon. Harry dawdled behind, taking an in
ordinate amount of time to 
do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Herm
ione wished him luck as they 
left; both looked rather annoyed. 
At last Harry and Slughorn were 
the only two left
 in the room. 
ÒCome on, now, Harry, youÕll be la
te for your next lesson,Ó said 
Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin 
briefcase. 
ÒSir,Ó said Harry, reminding himsel
f irresistibly of Voldemort, ÒI 
wanted to ask you something.Ó 
ÒAsk away, then, my dear
 boy, ask away. . . .Ó 
ÒSir, I wondered what you know
 about . . . ab
out Horcruxes?Ó 
Slughorn froze. His round face seem
ed to sink in upon itself. He 
licked his lips and said ho
arsely, ÒWhat did you say?Ó 
ÒI asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You 
see ÑÓ 
ÒDumbledore put you up to t
his,Ó whispered Slughorn. His 
voice had changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but 
shocked, terrified. He fumbled in 
his breast pocket
 and pulled out 
a handkerchief, mopping his swea
ting brow. ÒDumbledoreÕs shown 
you that Ñ that memory.
 Well? Hasn
Õt he?Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,68" ÒYes,Ó said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. 
ÒYes, of course,Ó said Slughorn qu
ietly, still dabbing at his white 
face. ÒOf course . . . well, if youÕve seen that memory, Harry, youÕll 
know that I donÕt know anything Ñ 
anythingÓ Ñ he repeated the 
word forcefully Ñ Òabout Horcruxes.Ó 
He seized his dragon-skin brie
fcase, stuffed his handkerchief 
back into his pocket, and ma
rched to the dungeon door. 
ÒSir,Ó said Harry desperately, ÒI 
just thought ther
e might be a bit 
more to the memory ÑÓ 
ÒDid you?Ó said Slughorn. ÒThen 
you were wrong, werenÕt you? 
WRONG!Ó He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another 
word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. 
Neither Ron nor Hermione was at
 all sympathetic when Harry 
told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething 
at the way Harry had triumphed wi
thout doing the work properly. 
Ron was resentful that Harry hadn
Õt slipped him a bezoar too. 
ÒIt wouldÕve just looked stupid if
 weÕd both done it!Ó said Harry 
irritably. ÒLook, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him 
about Voldemort, didn
Õt I? Oh, will you 
get a grip
!Ó he added in ex-
asperation, as Ron winced 
at the sound 
of the name. 
Infuriated by his failure and by
 RonÕs and HermioneÕs attitudes, 
Harry brooded for the next few days
 over what to do next about 
Slughorn. He decided that, for the 
time being, he would let Slug-
horn think that he had forgotten al
l about Horcruxes; it was surely 
best to lull him into a false sense 
of security before
 returning to the 
attack. When Harry did not question Sl
ughorn again, the Potions 
master reverted to his usual a
ffectionate treatment of him, and 
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,69" appeared to have put the matter
 from his mind. Harry awaited an 
invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept 
this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfor-
tunately, however, no such invita
tion arrived. Harry checked with 
Hermione and Ginny: Neither of th
em had received an invitation 
and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not 
help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as 
forgetful as he appear
ed, simply determined 
to give Harry no addi-
tional opportunities to question him. 
Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the 
first time in living memory. She 
was so shocked, she even forgot 
that she was annoyed at Harry 
for his trick with the bezoar. 
ÒI havenÕt found one single expl
anation of what Horcruxes do!Ó 
she told him. ÒNot a single one!
 IÕve been right through the re-
stricted section and even in the most 
horrible books, where they tell 
you how to brew the most 
gruesome
 potions Ñ nothing! All I could 
find was this, in the introduction to 
Magick Moste Evile
 Ñ listen Ñ 
ÔOf the Horcrux, wickedest of ma
gical inventions, we shall not 
speak nor give direction. . . .Õ 
I mean, why mention it then?Ó she 
said impatiently, slamming the old 
book shut; it let out a ghostly 
wail. ÒOh, shut up,Ó she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. 
The snow melted around the sch
ool as February arrived, to be 
replaced by cold, dreary wetness.
 Purplish-gray clouds hung low 
over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slip-
pery and muddy. The upshot of this 
was that the sixth yearsÕ first 
Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so 
that no normal lessons would be 
missed, took place in the Great 
Hall instead of 
in the grounds. 
When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,6:" down with Lavender), they found 
that the tables had disappeared. 
Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling 
swirled darkly above them as they 
assembled in front of Professors 
McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and 
Sprout Ñ the Heads of Houses 
Ñ and a small wizard whom Harry 
took to be the Apparition in-
structor from the Ministry. He wa
s oddly colorless, with transpar-
ent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insu
bstantial air, as though a single 
gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether con-
stant disappearances and reappe
arances had somehow diminished 
his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wish-
ing to vanish. 
ÒGood morning,Ó said 
the Ministry wizard, 
when all the stu-
dents had arrived and the Heads of
 Houses had called for quiet. 
ÒMy name is Wilkie Twycross and I 
shall be your Ministry Appari-
tion instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to 
prepare you for your Appariti
on Tests in this time ÑÓ 
ÒMalfoy, be quiet and pay atte
ntion!Ó barked Professor McGon-
agall. Everybody looked around. Malfoy
 had flushed a dull pink; he 
looked furious as he stepped away
 from Crabbe, with whom he ap-
peared to have been having a w
hispered argument. Harry glanced 
quickly at Snape, who also looked
 annoyed, though Harry strongly 
suspected that this was less becaus
e of MalfoyÕs rudeness than the 
fact that McGonagall had re
primanded one of his House. 
ÒÑ by which time, many of yo
u may be ready to take your 
tests,Ó Twycross continued, as th
ough there had been no inter-
ruption. ÒAs you may know, it is usuall
y impossible to Apparate or 
Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this en-
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,6," chantment, purely within the Great 
Hall, for one hour, so as to en-
able you to practice. May I emphas
ize that you will not be able to 
Apparate outside the walls of this
 Hall, and that you would be un-
wise to try. 
ÒI would like each of you to pl
ace yourselves now so that you 
have a clear five feet of
 space in front of you.Ó 
There was a great scrambling and 
jostling as people separated, 
banged into each other, and ordere
d others out of their space. The 
Heads of Houses moved among th
e students, marshaling them 
into position and breaking up arguments. 
ÒHarry, where are you going?Ó demanded Hermione. 
But Harry did not answer; he wa
s moving quickly through the 
crowd, past the place where Profe
ssor Flitwick was making squeaky 
attempts to position a few Ravenc
laws, all of whom wanted to be 
near the front, past Professor Sp
rout, who was chivying the Huf-
flepuffs into line, until, by dodg
ing around Ernie Macmillan, he 
managed to position himself right at
 the back of the 
crowd, directly 
behind Malfoy, who was taking ad
vantage of the general upheaval 
to continue his argument with Cr
abbe, standing five feet away and 
looking mutinous. 
ÒI donÕt know how much longer, all right?Ó Malfoy shot at him, 
oblivious to Harry standing right be
hind him. ÒItÕs taking longer 
than I thought it would.Ó 
Crabbe opened his mouth, but Ma
lfoy appeared to second-guess 
what he was going to say. ÒLook, itÕs none of your business what 
IÕm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just
 do as youÕre told and keep a 
lookout!Ó 
ÒI tell my friends what IÕm up to
, if I want them to keep a look-
out for me,Ó Harry said, just loud 
enough for Malfoy to hear him. 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,63" Malfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, 
but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, 
ÒQuiet!Ó and silence fell again. Ma
lfoy turned slowly to face the 
front again. 
ÒThank you,Ó said Twycro
ss. ÒNow then . . .Ó 
He waved his wand. Old-fashio
ned wooden hoops instantly ap-
peared on the floor in 
front of every student. 
ÒThe important things to remember when Apparating are the 
three DÕs!Ó said Twycross. ÒDesti
nation, Determination, Delibera-
tion! 
ÒStep one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired 
destination,
Ó said Twycross. ÒIn this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly con-
centrate upon that destination now.Ó 
Everybody looked around furtivel
y to check that everyone else 
was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. 
Harry gazed at the circular patch 
of dusty floor enclosed by his 
hoop and tried hard to think of 
nothing else. This proved impossi-
ble, as he couldnÕt stop puzzling 
over what Malfoy
 was doing that 
needed lookouts. 
ÒStep two,Ó said Twycross, Òfocus your 
determination to occupy 
the visualized space! Let your year
ning to enter it flood from your 
mind to every partic
le of your body!Ó 
Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, 
Ernie Macmillan was contemplating hi
s hoop so hard that his face 
had turned pink; it looked as th
ough he was straining to lay a 
Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back 
a laugh and hastily returned his 
gaze to his own hoop. 
ÒStep three,Ó called Twycross, Òand only when I give the com- 
 .)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,64" mand . . . Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, 
moving with 
deliberation
! On my command, now . . . one ÑÓ 
Harry glanced around again; lots
 of people were looking posi-
tively alarmed at being aske
d to Apparate so quickly. 
ÒÑ two ÑÓ 
Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already 
forgotten what the three DÕs stood for. 
ÒÑ THREE!Ó 
Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He 
was not the only one. The whole Ha
ll was suddenly full of stagger-
ing people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the 
other hand, had done a ki
nd of pirouetting leap into his hoop and 
looked momentarily thrilled, un
til he caught sight of Dean 
Thomas roaring with
 laughter at him. 
ÒNever mind, never mind,Ó said
 Twycross dryly, who did not 
seem to have expected anything be
tter. ÒAdjust your hoops, please, 
and back to your origin
al positions. . . .Ó 
The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was 
just as bad. Not until the fourth
 did anything exciting happen. 
There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, 
terrified, to see Susan Bones of 
Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop 
with her left leg still standing fi
ve feet away where she had started. 
The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang 
and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, 
reunited with her leg but looking horrified. 
ÒSplinching, or the separation 
of random body parts,Ó said 
Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, Òo
ccurs when the mind is insuffi-
ciently determined.
 You must concentrate continuously upon your  
 !#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,65" destination,
 and move, without haste, but with 
deliberation
 . . . 
thus.Ó Twycross stepped forward, turned gr
acefully on the spot with his 
arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at 
the back of the Hall. 
ÒRemember the three DÕs,Ó he sa
id, Òand try again . . . one Ñ 
two Ñ three ÑÓ 
But an hour later, SusanÕs Splinching was still the most interest-
ing thing that had happened. Twyc
ross did not seem discouraged. 
Fastening his cloak at his neck, 
he merely said, ÒUntil next Sat-
urday, everybody, and do not forget: 
Destination. Determination. 
Deliberation.Ó With that, he waved his wand, Va
nishing the hoops, and walked 
out of the Hall accompanied by 
Professor McGonagall. Talk broke 
out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall. 
ÒHow did you do?Ó asked Ron, hu
rrying toward Harry. ÒI think 
I felt something the last time I tr
ied Ñ a kind of tingling in my 
feet.Ó ÒI expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,Ó said a voice be-
hind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. 
ÒI didnÕt feel anything,Ó said Ha
rry, ignoring this interruption. 
ÒBut I donÕt care 
about that now ÑÓ 
ÒWhat dÕyou mean, you donÕt care? DonÕt you want to learn to 
Apparate?Ó said Ron incredulously. 
ÒIÕm not fussed, really, I prefer fl
ying,Ó said Harry, glancing over 
his shoulder to see where Malfoy 
was, and speeding up as they 
came into the entrance hall. ÒLook, hurry up, will you, thereÕs 
something I want to do. . . .Ó 
Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back
 to the Gryffindor Tower at 
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,6-" a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed 
a door on the fourth floor shut an
d was refusing to let anyone pass 
until they set fire to their ow
n pants, but Harry and Ron simply 
turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. Within five 
minutes, they were climbing
 through the portrait hole. 
ÒAre you going to tell me what 
weÕre doing, then?Ó asked Ron, 
panting slightly. 
ÒUp here,Ó said Harry, and he cr
ossed the common room and led 
the way through the door 
to the boysÕ staircase. 
Their dormitory was, as Harry had 
hoped, empty. He flung open 
his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched 
impatiently. 
ÒHarry . . .Ó 
ÒMalfoyÕs using Crabbe and Goyl
e as lookouts. He was arguing 
with Crabbe just now. 
I want to know Ñ aha.Ó 
He had found it, a folded square
 of apparently blank parchment, 
which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand. 
ÒI solemnly swear that I am up to no good
 . . . or Malfoy is any-
way.Ó At once, the MarauderÕs Map appeared on the parchmentÕs sur-
face. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castleÕs floors and, 
moving around it, the tiny, labeled 
black dots that signified each of 
the castleÕs occupants. 
ÒHelp me find Malfoy,Ó said Harry urgently. 
He laid the map upon his bed, 
and he and Ron leaned over it, 
searching. ÒThere!Ó said Ron, after a minute 
or so. ÒHeÕs in the Slytherin 
common room, look . . . with Pa
rkinson and Zabini and Crabbe 
and Goyle . . .Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,66" Harry looked down at the map, di
sappointed, but rallied almost 
at once. 
ÒWell, IÕm keeping an eye on him from now on,Ó he said firmly. 
ÒAnd the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and 
Goyle keeping watch outside, itÕll be on with the old Invisibility 
Cloak and off to find out what heÕs ÑÓ 
He broke off as Neville entered
 the dormitory, bringing with 
him a strong smell of singed mate
rial, and began rummaging in his 
trunk for a fresh pair of pants. 
Despite his determination to ca
tch Malfoy out, Harry had no 
luck at all over the next couple of
 weeks. Although he consulted the 
map as often as he could, someti
mes making unnecessary visits to 
the bathroom between lessons to se
arch it, he did not once see Mal-
foy anywhere suspicious. Admitted
ly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle 
moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, 
sometimes remaining stationary in 
deserted corridors, but at these 
times Malfoy was not only nowher
e near them, bu
t impossible to 
locate on the map at all. This
 was most mysterious. Harry toyed 
with the possibility that Malfoy 
was actually leaving the school 
grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very 
high level of security now operat
ing within the castle. He could 
only suppose that he was missing 
Malfoy amongst the hundreds of 
tiny black dots upon the map. As 
for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, 
and Goyle appeared to be going 
their different ways when they 
were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got 
older Ñ Ron and Hermione, Harry re
flected sadly, were living 
proof. February moved toward March with
 no change in the weather 
except that it became windy as well
 as wet. To general indignation, 
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,67" a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next 
trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled. Ron was furious. 
ÒIt was on my birthday!Ó he sa
id. ÒI was looking forward to 
that!Ó ÒNot a big surprise, though, is it
?Ó said Harry. ÒNot after what 
happened to Katie.Ó 
She had still not returned from St. MungoÕs. What was more, 
further disappearances had been reported in the 
Daily Prophet,
 in-
cluding several relatives of
 students at Hogwarts. 
ÒBut now all IÕve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!Ó 
said Ron grumpily. ÒBig 
birthday treat . . .Ó 
Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, 
though a few more people had 
managed to Splinch themselves. 
Frustration was running high and th
ere was a certain amount of ill-
feeling toward Wilkie Twycross an
d his three DÕs, which had in-
spired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were 
Dogbreath and Dunghead. 
ÒHappy birthday, Ron,Ó said Harry, when they were woken on 
the first of March by Seamus an
d Dean leaving noisily for break-
fast. ÒHave a present.Ó 
He threw the package across onto 
RonÕs bed, where it joined a 
small pile of them that must, Ha
rry assumed, have been delivered 
by house-elves in the night. 
ÒCheers,Ó said Ron drowsily and,
 as he ripped off the paper, 
Harry got out of bed,
 opened his own trunk, and began rummag-
ing in it for the Maraud
erÕs Map, which he hi
d after every use. He 
turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding 
beneath the rolled-up socks in whic
h he was still keeping his bottle 
of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,78" ÒRight,Ó he murmured, taking it 
back to bed with him, tapping 
it quietly and murmuring, Ò
I solemnly swear that I am up to no 
good,Ó so that Neville, who was passi
ng the foot of his bed at the 
time, would not hear. 
ÒNice one, Harry!Ó said Ron en
thusiastically, waving the new 
pair of Quidditch KeeperÕs 
gloves Harry had given him. 
ÒNo problem,Ó said Harry absentmi
ndedly, as he searched the 
Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy
. ÒHey . . . I donÕt think heÕs 
in his bed. . . .Ó 
Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every 
now and then letting out an
 exclamation of pleasure. 
ÒSeriously good haul this year!Ó
 he announced,
 holding up a 
heavy gold watch with odd symbols 
around the edge and tiny mov-
ing stars instead of hands. ÒSee what Mum and Dad got me? 
Blimey, I think IÕll come of 
age next year too. . . .Ó 
ÒCool,Ó muttered Harry, sparing th
e watch a glance before peer-
ing more closely at the map. Wh
ere was Malfoy? He did not seem 
to be at the Slytherin table in the 
Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . . 
He was nowhere near Snape, who was 
sitting in his study. . . . He 
wasnÕt in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. . . . 
ÒWant one?Ó said Ron thickly, 
holding out a box of Chocolate 
Cauldrons. 
ÒNo thanks,Ó said Ha
rry, looking up. ÒMal
foyÕs gone again!Ó 
ÒCanÕt have done,Ó said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his 
mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. ÒCome on, if you donÕt 
hurry up, youÕll have to Apparate on
 an empty stomach. . . . Might 
make it easier, I suppose . . .Ó Ro
n looked thoughtfully at the box 
of Chocolate Cauldrons, then sh
rugged and helped himself to a 
third. .)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,79" Harry tapped the map with his 
wand, muttered, ÒMischief man-
aged,Ó though it hadnÕt been, and 
got dressed, thinking hard. There 
had to be an explanation for Malf
oyÕs periodic disappearances, but 
he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of find-
ing out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibility Cloak 
this was an impractical idea: Ha
rry had lessons, Quidditch prac-
tice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy 
around school all day without his absence being remarked upon. 
ÒReady?Ó he said to Ron. 
He was halfway to the dormitory
 door when he realized that 
Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of 
the rain-washed window with a st
rangely unfocuse
d look on his 
face. ÒRon? Breakfast.Ó 
ÒIÕm not hungry.Ó 
Harry stared at him. 
ÒI thought you just said Ñ ?Ó 
ÒWell, all right, IÕll come down 
with you,Ó sighed Ron, Òbut I 
donÕt want to eat.Ó 
Harry scrutinized 
him suspiciously. 
ÒYouÕve just eaten half a box of
 Chocolate Cauldrons, havenÕt 
you?Ó ÒItÕs not that,Ó Ron sighed again.
 ÒYou . . . you wouldnÕt under-
stand.Ó 
ÒFair enough,Ó said Harry, albeit 
puzzled, as he turned to open 
the door. ÒHarry!Ó said Ron suddenly. 
ÒWhat?Ó 
ÒHarry, I canÕt stand it!Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,7:" ÒYou canÕt stand what?Ó asked Ha
rry, now starting to feel defi-
nitely alarmed. Ron was rather pa
le and looked as though he was 
about to be sick. 
ÒI canÕt stop thin
king about her!Ó said Ron hoarsely. 
Harry gaped at him. He had not ex
pected this and was not sure 
he wanted to hear it. Friends they
 might be, but if Ron started call-
ing Lavender ÒLav-Lav
,Ó he would have to
 put his foot down. 
ÒWhy does that stop you having 
breakfast?Ó Harry asked, trying 
to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. 
ÒI donÕt think she knows I exist,Ó said Ron with a desperate 
gesture. 
ÒShe definitely knows you exist,
Ó said Harry, bewildered. ÒShe 
keeps snogging you, doesnÕt she?Ó 
Ron blinked. ÒWho ar
e you talking about?Ó 
ÒWho are 
you talking about?Ó said Harry, with an increasing 
sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. 
ÒRomilda Vane,Ó said Ron softly, 
and his whole face seemed to 
illuminate as he said it, as though
 hit by a ray of 
purest sunlight. 
They stared at each other for 
almost a whole minute, before 
Harry said, ÒThis is a joke
, right? YouÕre joking.Ó 
ÒI think . . . Harry, I think I love
 her,Ó said Ron in a strangled 
voice. ÒOkay,Ó said Harry, walking up to 
Ron to get a better look at the 
glazed eyes and the pallid comple
xion, Òokay. . . Say that again 
with a straig
ht face.Ó 
ÒI love her,Ó repeated Ron brea
thlessly. ÒHave you seen her hair, 
itÕs all black and shin
y and silky . . . and he
r eyes? Her big dark 
eyes? And her ÑÓ 
 .)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,7," ÒThis is really funny and ever
ything,Ó said Harry impatiently, 
Òbut jokeÕs over, all right? Drop it.Ó 
He turned to leave; he had go
t two steps toward the door when 
a crashing blow hit him on the ri
ght ear. Staggering, he looked 
around. RonÕs fist was drawn righ
t back; his face was contorted 
with rage; he was abou
t to strike again. 
Harry reacted instinctively; his wa
nd was out of his pocket and 
the incantation sprang to mind
 without conscious thought: 
Levi-corpus! Ron yelled as his heel was wrenc
hed upward once more; he dan-
gled helplessly, upside down,
 his robes hanging off him. 
ÒWhat was that for
?Ó Harry bellowed. 
ÒYou insulted her, Harry! You sa
id it was a joke!Ó shouted Ron, 
who was slowly turning purple in th
e face as all the blood rushed to 
his head. 
ÒThis is insane!Ó said Harry. ÒWhatÕs got into Ñ ?Ó 
And then he saw the box lying open on RonÕs bed, and the truth 
hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. 
ÒWhere did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?Ó 
ÒThey were a birthday present!Ó shouted Ron, revolving slowly in 
midair as he struggled to get free.
 ÒI offered you one, didnÕt I?Ó 
ÒYou just picked them up 
off the floor, didnÕt you?Ó 
ÒTheyÕd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!Ó 
ÒThey didnÕt fall off your bed, you prat, donÕt you understand? 
They were mine, I chucked them ou
t of my trunk when I was look-
ing for the map, theyÕre the Choc
olate Cauldrons Romilda gave me 
before Christmas, and theyÕre al
l spiked with love potion!Ó 
But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. 
 !#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,73" ÒRomilda?Ó he repeated. ÒDid
 you say Romilda? Harry Ñ do 
you know her? Can 
you introduce me?Ó 
Harry stared at the dangling 
Ron, whose face now looked 
tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part 
of him Ñ the part closest to his throbbing right ear Ñ was quite 
keen on the idea of letting Ro
n down and watching him run amok 
until the effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other hand, 
they were supposed to be friend
s, Ron had not been himself when 
he had attacked, and Harry thought 
that he would deserve another 
punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda 
Vane. ÒYeah, IÕll introduce you,Ó said 
Harry, thinking fast. ÒIÕm going 
to let you down now, okay?Ó 
He sent Ron crashing back to the 
floor (his ear did hurt quite a 
lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning. 
ÒSheÕll be in SlughornÕs office,Ó
 said Harry confidently, leading 
the way to the door. 
ÒWhy will she be in there?Ó as
ked Ron anxiously, hurrying to 
keep up. 
ÒOh, she has extra Potions lessons
 with him,Ó said Harry, in-
venting wildly. 
ÒMaybe I could ask if I can ha
ve them with her?Ó said Ron 
eagerly. 
ÒGreat idea,Ó said Harry. 
Lavender was waiting beside the 
portrait hole, a complication 
Harry had not foreseen. 
ÒYouÕre late, Won-Won!Ó she pouted
. ÒIÕve got you a birthday ÑÓ 
ÒLeave me alone,Ó said Ron impa
tiently. ÒHarryÕs going to intro-
duce me to Romilda Vane.Ó 
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,74" And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the 
portrait hole. Harry tried to make 
an apologetic face to Lavender, 
but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked 
more offended than ever as the 
Fat Lady swung shut behind them. 
Harry had been slightly worried 
that Slughorn might be at 
breakfast, but he answer
ed his office door at 
the first knock, wear-
ing a green velvet dressing gown 
and matching nightcap and look-
ing rather bleary-eyed. 
ÒHarry,Ó he mumbled. ÒThis is ve
ry early for a call. . . . I gener-
ally sleep late on 
a Saturday. . . .Ó 
ÒProfessor, IÕm really sorry to di
sturb you,Ó said Harry as quietly 
as possible, while Ron stood on ti
ptoe, attempting to see past 
Slughorn into his room, Òbut my 
friend RonÕs swallowed a love po-
tion by mistake. You couldnÕt make
 him an antidote, could you? IÕd 
take him to Madam Pomfrey, but weÕre not supposed to have any-
thing from WeasleysÕ Wizard Wh
eezes and, you know . . . awk-
ward questions . . .Ó 
ÒIÕd have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, 
Harry, an expert potioneer 
like you?Ó asked Slughorn. 
ÒEr,Ó said Harry, somewhat distra
cted by the fact that Ron was 
now elbowing him in the ribs in 
an attempt to force his way into 
the room, Òwell, IÕve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, 
sir, and by the time I get it ri
ght, Ron mightÕve done something 
serious ÑÓ 
Helpfully, Ron chose this moment
 to moan, ÒI canÕt see her, 
Harry Ñ is he 
hiding her?Ó 
ÒWas this potion within date?Ó asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron 
with professional interest. ÒThe
y can strengthen, you know, the 
longer theyÕre kept.Ó 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,75" ÒThat would explain a lot,Ó pa
nted Harry, now positively 
wrestling with Ron to keep him fr
om knocking Slughorn over. ÒItÕs 
his birthday, Professor,Ó he added imploringly. 
ÒOh, all right, come in, then, co
me in,Ó said Slughorn, relent-
ing. ÒIÕve got the necessary here in my bag, itÕs not a difficult 
antidote. . . .Ó 
Ron burst through the door into 
SlughornÕs overheated, crowded 
study, tripped over a tasseled footst
ool, regained his balance by seiz-
ing Harry around the neck, and mutte
red, ÒShe didnÕt see that, did 
she?Ó ÒSheÕs not here yet,Ó said Har
ry, watching Slughorn opening his 
potion kit and adding a few pinches 
of this and that 
to a small crys-
tal bottle. 
ÒThatÕs good,Ó said Ron fe
rvently. ÒHow do I look?Ó ÒVery handsome,Ó said Slughorn
 smoothly, handing Ron a glass 
of clear liquid. ÒNow drink that up, itÕs a tonic for the nerves, keep 
you calm when she arrives, you know.Ó 
ÒBrilliant,Ó said Ron eagerly, 
and he gulped the antidote down 
noisily. Harry and Slughorn watched him
. For a moment, Ron beamed 
at them. Then, very slowly, his grin
 sagged and vanished, to be re-
placed by an expressi
on of utmost horror. 
ÒBack to normal, then?Ó said Ha
rry, grinning. Slughorn chuck-
led. ÒThanks a lot, Professor.Ó 
ÒDonÕt mention it, mÕboy, donÕt 
mention it,Ó said Slughorn, as 
Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. ÒPick-
me-up, thatÕs what he needs,Ó Sl
ughorn continued, now bustling 
over to a table loaded with drin
ks. ÒIÕve got butterbeer, IÕve got 
wine, IÕve got one last bottle of th
is oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . 
.)(&#/$0""12(%()1'1" ,7-" meant to give that to Dumbledore fo
r Christmas . . . ah, well . . .Ó 
He shrugged. ÒHe canÕt miss what 
heÕs never had! Why donÕt we 
open it now and celebrate Mr. Weas
leyÕs birthday? Nothing like a 
fine spirit to chase away the pa
ngs of disappointed love. . . .Ó 
He chortled again, and Harry joi
ned in. This was the first time 
he had found himself almost alon
e with Slughorn since his disas-
trous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, 
if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they 
got through enough of th
e oak-matured mead . . . 
ÒThere you are then,Ó said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a 
glass of mead each before rais
ing his own. ÒWell, a very happy 
birthday, Ralph ÑÓ 
ÒRon ÑÓ whispered Harry. 
But Ron, who did not appear to be
 listening to the toast, had al-
ready thrown the mead into 
his mouth and swallowed it. 
There was one second, hardly more
 than a heartbeat, in which 
Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it 
seemed, did not. 
ÒÑ and may you have many more ÑÓ 
ÒRon
!Ó Ron had dropped his glass; he ha
lf-rose from his chair and then 
crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was drib-
bling from his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. 
ÒProfessor!Ó Harry bellowed. ÒDo something!Ó 
But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron twitched and 
choked: His skin was turning blue. 
ÒWhat Ñ but ÑÓ spluttered Slughorn. 
Harry leapt over a low table an
d sprinted toward SlughornÕs 
open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible 
!#$%&'(""')*#&''+"
 ,76" sound of RonÕs gargling breath fi
lled the room. Then he found it Ñ 
the shriveled kidneylike stone Sl
ughorn had taken from him in 
Potions. 
He hurtled back to RonÕs side, wrenched open his jaw, and 
thrust the bezoar into his mouth.
 Ron gave a great shudder, a rat-
tling gasp, and his body 
became limp and still.

   o, all in all, not one of RonÕs better birthdays?Ó said Fred. 
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows 
curtained, the lamps lit. RonÕs wa
s the only occupied bed. Harry, 
Hermione, and Ginny were sitting 
around him; they had spent all 
day waiting outside the double doors,
 trying to see inside whenever 
somebody went in or 
out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them en-
ter at eight oÕclock. Fred and 
George had arrive
d at ten past. 
ÒThis isnÕt how we imagined ha
nding over our present,Ó said 
George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on RonÕs bedside 
cabinet and sittin
g beside Ginny. 
ÒYeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,Ó said Fred. 
ÒThere we were in Hogsmeade, wa
iting to surprise him ÑÓ said 
George. ÒYou were in Hogsmeade?Ó 
asked Ginny, looking up. 
ÒWe were thinking of buying Zo
nkoÕs,Ó said Fred gloomily. ÒA 
Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a 
fat lot of good itÕll do us if 
/"!#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 011" you lot arenÕt allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore. 
. . . But never mind that now.Ó 
He drew up a chair beside Harry 
and looked at RonÕs pale face. 
ÒHow exactly did it
 happen, Harry?Ó 
Harry retold the story he had alre
ady recounted, it felt like a 
hundred times to Dumbledore, 
to McGonagall, to Madam Pom-
frey, to Hermione, and to Ginny. 
Ò. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing 
eased up a bit, Slughorn ran 
for help, McGonagall and Madam 
Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon 
heÕll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says
 heÕll have to stay here a week 
or so . . . keep taking
 essence of rue . . .Ó 
ÒBlimey, it was lucky you thought 
of a bezoar,Ó said George in a 
low voice. 
ÒLucky there was one in the room,Ó said Harry, who kept turn-
ing cold at the thought of what 
would have happened if he had not 
been able to lay hand
s on the little stone. 
Hermione gave an almost inaudi
ble sniff. She had been excep-
tionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry 
outside the hospital wing and de
manded to know what had hap-
pened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and GinnyÕs obses-
sive discussion about how Ron 
had been poisoned, but merely 
stood beside them, clench-jawed an
d frightened-looking, until at 
last they had been al
lowed in to see him. 
ÒDo Mum and Dad know?Ó Fred asked Ginny. 
ÒTheyÕve already seen him, they
 arrived an hour ago Ñ theyÕre 
in DumbledoreÕs office
 now, but theyÕll be
 back soon. . . .Ó 
There was a pause while they all 
watched Ron mumble a little in 
his sleep. 
'-.""&$*-/"
 012" ÒSo the poison was in the dr
ink?Ó said Fred quietly. 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry at on
ce; he could think of nothing else and was 
glad for the opportunit
y to start discussing 
it again. ÒSlughorn 
poured it out ÑÓ 
ÒWould he have been able to 
slip something into RonÕs glass 
without you seeing?Ó 
ÒProbably,Ó said Harry, Òbut wh
y would Slughorn want to poi-
son Ron?Ó 
ÒNo idea,Ó said Fred, frowning. 
ÒYou donÕt think he could have 
mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?Ó 
ÒWhy would Slughorn want to 
poison Harry?Ó 
asked Ginny. 
ÒI dunno,Ó said Fred, Òbut there 
must be loads of people whoÕd 
like to poison Harry, mustnÕt there? ÔThe Chosen OneÕ and all that?Ó 
ÒSo you think SlughornÕs a 
Death Eater?Ó said Ginny. 
ÒAnythingÕs possible,Ó said Fred darkly. 
ÒHe could be under the Imperius Curse,Ó said George. 
ÒOr he could be innocent,Ó said
 Ginny. ÒThe poison could have 
been in the bottle, in which case
 it was probably meant for Slug-
horn himself.Ó 
ÒWhoÕd want to kill Slughorn?Ó 
ÒDumbledore reckons Voldemort wa
nted Slughorn on his side,Ó 
said Harry. ÒSlughorn was in hiding 
for a year before
 he came to 
Hogwarts. And . . .Ó He though
t of the memory Dumbledore had 
not yet been able to extract from
 Slughorn. ÒAnd maybe Voldemort 
wants him out of the way,
 maybe he thinks he could be valuable to 
Dumbledore.Ó ÒBut you said Slughorn had been pl
anning to give that bottle to 
Dumbledore for Christmas,Ó Ginny reminded him. ÒSo the poi-
soner could just as easily ha
ve been after 
Dumbledore.Ó 
!#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 013" ÒThen the poisoner didnÕt know 
Slughorn very well,Ó said Her-
mione, speaking for the first time 
in hours and sounding as though 
she had a bad head cold. ÒAnyone 
who knew Slughorn would have 
known there was a good chance heÕd
 keep something that tasty for 
himself.Ó 
ÒEr-my-nee,Ó croaked Ron unexpe
ctedly from between them. 
They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering 
incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring. 
The dormitory doors flew open, ma
king them all jump: Hagrid 
came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat 
flapping behind him, a crossbow 
in his hand, leaving a trail of 
muddy dolphin-sized footpr
ints all over the floor. 
ÒBin in the forest all day!Ó he
 panted. ÒAragogÕs worse, I bin 
readinÕ to him Ñ didnÕ get up ter dinner till jusÕ now anÕ then Pro-
fessor Sprout told me abouÕ Ron! How is he?Ó 
ÒNot bad,Ó said Harry. ÒT
hey say heÕll be okay.Ó 
ÒNo more than six visitors at a 
time!Ó said Madam Pomfrey, hur-
rying out of her office. 
ÒHagrid makes six,Ó Ge
orge pointed out. 
ÒOh . . . yes . . .Ó said Madam 
Pomfrey, who seemed to have 
been counting Hagrid 
as several people due 
to his vastness. To 
cover her confusion, she hurried o
ff to clear up his muddy foot-
prints with her wand. 
ÒI donÕ believe this,Ó said Hagr
id hoarsely, shaking his great 
shaggy head as he stared down at
 Ron. ÒJusÕ donÕ believe it . . . 
Look at him lyinÕ there. . . . 
WhoÕd want ter hurt him, eh?Ó 
ÒThatÕs just what we were discussing,Ó said Harry. ÒWe donÕt 
know.Ó 
 '-.""&$*-/"
 01+" ÒSomeone couldnÕ have a grudge 
against the Gryffindor Quid-
ditch team, could they?Ó said Hagr
id anxiously. ÒFirsÕ Katie, now 
Ron . . .Ó 
ÒI canÕt see anyone trying to bu
mp off a Quidditch team,Ó said 
George. ÒWood mightÕve done the Slytherins
 if he couldÕve got away 
with it,Ó said Fred fairly. 
ÒWell, I donÕt think itÕs Quiddi
tch, but I think thereÕs a connec-
tion between the attacks,Ó said Hermione quietly. 
ÒHow dÕyou work that out?Ó asked Fred. 
ÒWell, for one thing, they both
 ought to have been fatal and 
werenÕt, although that was pure 
luck. And for another, neither the 
poison nor the necklace 
seems to have reache
d the person who was 
supposed to be killed. Of cour
se,Ó she added broodingly, Òthat 
makes the person behind this even
 more dangerous in a way, be-
cause they donÕt seem to care ho
w many people they finish off 
before they actually 
reach their victim.Ó 
Before anybody could respond to
 this ominous pronouncement, 
the dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hur-
ried up the ward. They had done no
 more than satisfy themselves 
that Ron would make a full recovery 
on their last visit to the ward; 
now Mrs. Weasley seized hold
 of Harry and hugged him very 
tightly. ÒDumbledoreÕs told us 
how you saved him with the be-
zoar,Ó she sobbed. ÒOh, Harry, wh
at can we say? You saved Ginny 
. . . you saved Arthur . . . 
now youÕve saved Ron . . .Ó 
ÒDonÕt be . . . I didnÕt . .

ÒHalf our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop 
and think about it,Ó Mr. 
Weasley said in a constr
icted voice. ÒWell,

 010" all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron 
decided to sit in your compartm
ent on the Hogwarts Express, 
Harry.Ó 
Harry could not think of any repl
y to this and was almost glad 
when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only sup-
posed to be six visitors around Ro
nÕs bed; he and Hermione rose at 
once to leave and Hagrid decide
d to go with them, leaving Ron 
with his family. 
ÒItÕs terrible,Ó growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of 
them walked back along the corridor
 to the marble staircase. ÒAll

worried sick. . . . He donÕ sa

ÒHasnÕt he got any idea

ÒI Õspect heÕs got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,Ó said Hagrid. 
ÒBut he doesnÕ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that 
wine, or theyÕdÕve bin caught, wo
uldnÕ they? WhaÕ worries me,Ó 
said Hagrid, lowering his voice 
and glancing over
 his shoulder 
(Harry, for good measure, checked 
the ceiling for Peeves), Òis how

ghost of a long-haired woman 
drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, Ò. . . the

about shuttinÕ us up fer good.Ó 
ÒSurely not?Ó said Hermione, looking worried. 
ÒGotta see it from their point oÕ

 015" agreed ter do it anÕ that was all ther
e was to it. Pretty firm with him. 
AnÕ then he said summat abouÕ Sn
ape makinÕ investigations in his 
House, in Slytherin. Well, thereÕ
s nothinÕ strange abouÕ that!Ó Ha-
grid added hastily, as Harry and He
rmione exchanged looks full of 
meaning. ÒAll the Heads oÕ Houses were asked ter look inter that 
necklace business ÑÓ 
ÒYeah, but DumbledoreÕs not having
 rows with the rest of them, 
is he?Ó said Harry. 
ÒLook,Ó Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his 
hands; there was a loud splintering 
sound and it snapped in two. ÒI 
know what yehÕre like abouÕ Snap
e, Harry, anÕ I donÕ want yeh ter 
go readinÕ more inter 
this than there is.Ó 
ÒLook out,Ó said He
rmione tersely. 
They turned just in time to se
e the shadow of 
Argus Filch loom-
ing over the wall behind them be
fore the man himself turned the 
corner, hunchbacked, 
his jowls aquiver. 
ÒOho!Ó he wheezed. ÒOut of bed so
 late, thisÕll me
an detention!Ó 
ÒNo it wonÕ, Filch,Ó said Hagrid 
shortly. ÒTheyÕre with me, arenÕ 
they?Ó ÒAnd what difference does that 
make?Ó asked Filch obnoxiously. 
ÒIÕm a ruddy teacher, arenÕ I, yeh sneakinÕ Squib!Ó said Hagrid, 
firing up at once. 
There was a nasty hissing noise as
 Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. 
Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously 
around FilchÕs skinny ankles. 
ÒGet goinÕ,Ó said Hagrid out 
of the corner of his mouth. 
Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried 
off; HagridÕs and FilchÕs raised voic
es echoed behind them as they  
 '-.""&$*-/"
 016" ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, 
but he was streaking happily toward 
the source of the yelling, cack-
ling and calling, 
 When thereÕs strife and when thereÕs trouble 
Call on Peevsie, heÕll make double!
  The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but 
swung forward grumpily to allow 
them to clamber into the merci-
fully peaceful and empty common 
room. It did not seem that peo-
ple knew about Ron yet; Harry wa
s very relieved: He had been 
interrogated enough that day. He
rmione bade him good night and 
set off for the girlsÕ dormitory. 
Harry, however, remained behind, 
taking a seat beside the fire 
and looking down into the dying 
embers. 
So Dumbledore had argued with Sn
ape. In spite of all he had 
told Harry, in spite of his insist
ence that he trusted Snape com-
pletely, he had lost his temper with
 him. . . . He did not think that 
Snape had tried hard enough to in
vestigate the Slytherins . . . or, 
perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy? 
Was it because Dumbledore did 
not want Harry to do anything 
foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended 
there was nothing in HarryÕs suspic
ions? That seemed likely. It 
might even be that Dumbledore did 
not want anything to distract 
Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from 
Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did 
not think it right to confide 
suspicions about his staff to
 sixteen-year-olds. . . . 
ÒThere you are, Potter!Ó 
 !#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 017" Harry jumped to his feet 
in shock, his wand at
 the ready. He had 
been quite convinced that the 
common room was empty; he had 
not been at all prepared 
for a hulking figure to
 rise suddenly out of 
a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac 
McLaggen. 
ÒIÕve been waiting for 
you to come back,Ó said McLaggen, disre-
garding HarryÕs drawn wand. ÒMustÕ
ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw 
them taking Weasley up to the hosp
ital wing earlie
r. DidnÕt look 
like heÕll be fit for 
next weekÕs match.Ó 
It took Harry a few moments to
 realize what McLaggen was 
talking about. 
ÒOh . . . right . . . Quidditch,Ó 
he said, putting his wand back 
into the belt of his jeans and ru
nning a hand wearily through his 
hair. ÒYeah . . . he 
might not make it.Ó 
ÒWell, then, IÕll be
 playing Keeper, wonÕ
t I?Ó said McLaggen. 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry. ÒYea
h, I suppose so. . . .Ó 
He could not think of an argu
ment against it; after all, 
McLaggen had certainly performe
d second-best in the trials. 
ÒExcellent,Ó said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. ÒSo whenÕs prac-
tice?Ó 
ÒWhat? Oh . . . thereÕs one tomorrow evening.Ó 
ÒGood. Listen, Potter, we should ha
ve a talk beforehand. IÕve got 
some ideas on strategy 
you might find useful.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry unenthusiasticall
y. ÒWell, IÕll hear them to-
morrow, then. IÕm pretty tire
d now . . . see you . . .Ó 
The news that Ron had been poiso
ned spread quickly next day, 
but it did not cause the sensation 
that KatieÕs attack had done. Peo-
ple seemed to think that it might 
have been an acci
dent, given that 
he had been in the Poti
ons masterÕs room at 
the time, and that as 
'-.""&$*-/"
 01," he had been given an antidote imme
diately there was no real harm 
done. In fact, the Gryffindors were
 generally much more interested 
in the upcoming Quidditch match 
against Hufflepuff, for many of 
them wanted to see Zacharias Sm
ith, who played Chaser on the 
Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the 
opening match against Slytherin. 
Harry, however, had never been le
ss interested in Quidditch; he 
was rapidly becoming obsessed with
 Draco Malfoy. Still checking 
the MarauderÕs Map whenever he
 got a chance, he sometimes 
made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet 
detected him doing anything out 
of the ordinary. And still there 
were those inexplicable times when
 Malfoy simply vanished from 
the map. . . . 
But Harry did not get a lot of ti
me to consider the problem, 
what with Quidditch practice, home
work, and the fact that he was 
now being dogged wherever he 
went by Cormac McLaggen and 
Lavender Brown. 
He could not decide which of them was more annoying. 
McLaggen kept up a constant stream
 of hints that he would make 
a better permanent Keeper for th
e team than Ron, and that now 
that Harry was seeing him play 
regularly he would surely come 
around to this way of thinking too;
 he was also keen to criticize the 
other players and provide Harry with
 detailed training schemes, so 
that more than once Harry was 
forced to remind him who was 
Captain. Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidlin
g up to Harry to discuss Ron, 
which Harry found almost more 
wearing than McLaggenÕs Quid-
ditch lectures. At first, Lavend
er had been very annoyed that 
nobody had thought to tell her 
that Ron was in the hospital 
!#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 021" wing Ñ ÒI mean, I 
am his girlfriend!Ó Ñ but unfortunately she 
had now decided to forgive Harry 
this lapse of memory and was 
keen to have lots of 
in-depth chats with him
 about RonÕs feelings, 
a most uncomfortable experience 
that Harry would have happily 
forgone. 
ÒLook, why donÕt you talk to Ron 
about all this?Ó Harry asked, 
after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in 
everything from precisely what Ro
n had said about her new dress 
robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his re-
lationship with
 Lavender to be Òserious.Ó 
ÒWell, I would, but heÕs always 
asleep when I go and see him!Ó 
said Lavender fretfully. 
ÒIs he?Ó said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly 
alert every time he had been up 
to the hospital 
wing, both highly 
interested in the news of Dumble
dore and SnapeÕs row and keen to 
abuse McLaggen as much as possible. 
ÒIs Hermione Granger still visiti
ng him?Ó Lavender demanded 
suddenly. ÒYeah, I think so. Well, theyÕre friends, arenÕt they?Ó said Harry 
uncomfortably. 
ÒFriends, donÕt make me laugh,Ó 
said Lavender scornfully. ÒShe 
didnÕt talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! 
But I suppose she wants to make
 up with him now heÕs all 
inter-esting. 
. . .Ó 
ÒWould you call getting poisoned being interesting?Ó asked 
Harry. ÒAnyway Ñ sorry, got to go
 Ñ thereÕs McLaggen coming 
for a talk about Quidditch,Ó said
 Harry hurriedly, and he dashed 
sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted  
 '-.""&$*-/"
 022" down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, 
thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him. 
On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, 
Harry dropped in on the hospital 
wing before heading down to the 
pitch. Ron was very agitated; Ma
dam Pomfrey would not let him 
go down to watch the match, feel
ing it would overexcite him. 
ÒSo howÕs McLaggen shaping up?Ó he asked Harry nervously, ap-
parently forgetting that he had already asked the same question 
twice. 
ÒIÕve told you,Ó said Harry patiently, Òhe could be world-class 
and I wouldnÕt want to keep him. 
He keeps trying to tell everyone 
what to do, he thinks he could pl
ay every position better than the 
rest of us. I canÕt wait to be sh
ot of him. And spea
king of getting 
shot of people,Ó Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his 
Firebolt, Òwill you stop pretendin
g to be asleep when Lavender 
comes to see you? SheÕs driving me mad as well.Ó 
ÒOh,Ó said Ron, looking sh
eepish. ÒYeah. All right.Ó 
ÒIf you donÕt want to go out with 
her anymore, just tell her,Ó said 
Harry. ÒYeah . . . well . . . itÕs not that easy, is it?Ó said Ron. He paused. 
ÒHermione going to look in before the match?Ó he added casually. 
ÒNo, sheÕs already 
gone down to the pi
tch with Ginny.Ó 
ÒOh,Ó said Ron, looking rather
 glum. ÒRight. Well, good luck. 
Hope you hammer McLa
g Ñ I mean, Smith.Ó 
ÒIÕll try,Ó said Harry, shoulder
ing his broom. ÒSee you after the 
match.Ó 
He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole 
school was outside, either already 
seated in the stadium or heading  
 !#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 023" down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, try-
ing to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead 
made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him, ac-
companied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful. 
Malfoy stopped short at the sigh
t of Harry, then gave a short, 
humorless laugh and continued walking. 
ÒWhereÕre you going?
Ó Harry demanded. 
ÒYeah, IÕm really going to tell you, because itÕs your business, 
Potter,Ó sneered Malfoy. ÒYouÕd be
tter hurry up, theyÕll be waiting 
for Ôthe Chosen CaptainÕ Ñ Ôthe
 Boy Who ScoredÕ Ñ whatever 
they call you these days.Ó 
One of the girls gave 
an unwilling giggle. Ha
rry stared at her. 
She blushed. Malfoy pushed past
 Harry and she and her friend fol-
lowed at a trot, turn
ing the corner and vanishing from view. 
Harry stood rooted on the spot 
and watched them disappear. 
This was infuriating; he was alre
ady cutting it fine to get to the 
match on time and yet there was Ma
lfoy, skulking off while the rest 
of the school was absent: HarryÕs 
best chance yet of discovering 
what Malfoy was up to. The silent
 seconds trickled past, and Harry 
remained where he was, frozen, ga
zing at the place where Malfoy 
had vanished. . . . 
ÒWhere have you been?Ó demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted 
into the changing rooms. The wh
ole team was changed and ready; 
Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, we
re both hitting their clubs ner-
vously against their legs. 
ÒI met Malfoy,Ó Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet 
robes over his head. 
ÒSo?Ó 
 '-.""&$*-/"
 02+" ÒSo I wanted to know how come heÕs up at the castle with a cou-
ple of girlfriends while everyo
ne else is down here. . . .Ó 
ÒDoes it matter right now?Ó 
ÒWell, IÕm not likely to find ou
t, am I?Ó said Harry, seizing his 
Firebolt and pushing his glasse
s straight. ÒCome on then!Ó 
And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to 
deafening cheers and boos. 
There was little wind; the clou
ds were patchy; every now and 
then there were dazzling fl
ashes of bright sunlight. 
ÒTricky conditions!Ó McLaggen said bracingly to the team. 
ÒCoote, Peakes, youÕll wa
nt to fly out of the sun, so they donÕt see 
you coming ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm the Captain, McLaggen, shut 
up giving them instructions,Ó 
said Harry angrily. ÒJust ge
t up by the 
goal posts!Ó 
Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and 
Peakes. ÒMake sure you 
do fly out of the sun,Ó he
 told them grudgingly. 
He shook hands with the Huff
lepuff Captain, and then, on 
Madam HoochÕs whistle, kicked o
ff and rose into the air, higher 
than the rest of his team, streaking 
around the pitch in search of the 
Snitch. If he could catch it good an
d early, there might be a chance 
he could get back up to the cas
tle, seize the MarauderÕs Map, and 
find out what Malf
oy was doing. . . . ÒAnd thatÕs Smith of Hufflepuff wi
th the Quaffle,Ó said a dreamy 
voice, echoing over the ground
s. ÒHe did the commentary last 
time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think proba-
bly on purpose, it looked like it
. Smith was being quite rude about 
Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now heÕs playing them Ñ oh,  
 !#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 020" look, heÕs lost the Quaffle, Ginny 
took it from him,
 I do like her, 
sheÕs very nice. . . .Ó 
Harry stared down at the comm
entatorÕs podium. Surely no-
body in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commen-
tate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, 
dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace 
of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside 
Luna, Professor McGonagall was lo
oking slightly uncomfortable, 
as though she was indeed having
 second thoughts about this 
appointment. Ò. . . but now that big Hufflepuf
f playerÕs got the Quaffle from 
her, I canÕt remember his name, it
Õs something like Bibble Ñ no, 
Buggins ÑÓ 
ÒItÕs Cadwallader!Ó said Professo
r McGonagall loudly from be-
side Luna. The 
crowd laughed. 
Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Mo-
ments later, Cadwallader scor
ed. McLaggen had been shouting 
criticism at Ginny for allowing 
the Quaffle out of her possession, 
with the result that 
he had not noticed the 
large red ball soaring 
past his right ear. 
ÒMcLaggen, will you pay attentio
n to what youÕre supposed to 
be doing and leave everyone else
 alone!Ó bellowed Harry, wheeling 
around to face his Keeper. 
ÒYouÕre not setting a great example!Ó McLaggen shouted back, 
red-faced and furious. 
ÒAnd Harry PotterÕs now having an argument with his Keeper,Ó 
said Luna serenely, while both Hu
fflepuffs and Slytherins below in 
the crowd cheered and jeered. ÒI don
Õt think thatÕll help him find 
the Snitch, but maybe itÕs
 a clever ruse. . . .Ó  '-.""&$*-/"
 024" Swearing angrily, Harry spun ro
und and set off around the pitch 
again, scanning the skies for some 
sign of the tiny, winged golden 
ball. Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-
gold-clad supporters below somet
hing to cheer about. Then Cad-
wallader scored again, making thin
gs level, but Luna did not seem 
to have noticed; she appeared sing
ularly uninterested in such mun-
dane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowdÕs 
attention to such things as intere
stingly shaped clouds and the pos-
sibility that Zacharias Smith, wh
o had so far failed to maintain 
possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering 
from something called ÒLoserÕs Lurgy.Ó 
ÒSeventy-forty to Hu
fflepuff!Ó barked 
Professor McGonagall 
into LunaÕs megaphone. 
ÒIs it, already?Ó said Luna vagu
ely. ÒOh, look! The Gryffindor 
KeeperÕs got hold of one 
of the BeaterÕs bats.Ó 
Harry spun around in midair. 
Sure enough, McLa
ggen, for rea-
sons best known to himself, had 
pulled PeakesÕs bat from him and 
appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an on-
coming Cadwallader. 
ÒWill you give him back his bat an
d get back to the goal posts
!Ó roared Harry, pelting toward Mc
Laggen just as McLaggen took a 
ferocious swipe at the 
Bludger and mishit it. 
A blinding, sickening pain . . . a flash of light . . . distant 
screams . . . and the se
nsation of falling down 
a long tunnel . . . 
And the next thing Harry knew, he
 was lying in a remarkably 
warm and comfortable bed and l
ooking up at a lamp that was 
throwing a circle of go
lden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised  
 !#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 025" his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, 
freckly, red-haired person. 
ÒNice of you to drop in,Ó said Ron, grinning. 
Harry blinked and looked around. 
Of course: He was in the hos-
pital wing. The sky outside was indi
go streaked with crimson. The 
match must have finished hours ago . . . as had any hope of cor-
nering Malfoy. HarryÕs head felt stra
ngely heavy; he raised a hand 
and felt a stiff turban of bandages. 
ÒWhat happened?Ó 
ÒCracked skull,Ó said Madam Pomf
rey, bustling up and pushing 
him back against his pillows. ÒNot
hing to worry about, I mended 
it at once, but IÕm keeping you in overnight. You shouldnÕt over-
exert yourself for a few hours.Ó 
ÒI donÕt want to stay here over
night,Ó said Harry angrily, sitting 
up and throwing back 
his covers. ÒI want to find McLaggen and 
kill him.Ó 
ÒIÕm afraid that wo
uld come under the heading of Ôoverexer-
tion,ÕÓ said Madam Pomfrey, pushin
g him firmly back onto the bed 
and raising her wand in a threatening manner. ÒYou will stay here 
until I discharge you, Potter, or
 I shall call the headmaster.Ó 
She bustled back into her office
, and Harry sank back into his 
pillows, fuming. 
ÒDÕyou know how much we lost by?Ó he asked Ron through 
clenched teeth. 
ÒWell, yeah I do,Ó said Ron apologetically. ÒFinal score was three 
hundred and twen
ty to sixty.Ó 
ÒBrilliant,Ó said Harry savagely. ÒReally brilliant! When I get 
hold of McLaggen ÑÓ 
ÒYou donÕt want to get hold of him, heÕs the size of a troll,Ó said 
'-.""&$*-/"
 026" Ron reasonably. ÒPersonally, I think 
thereÕs a lot to be said for hex-
ing him with that toenail thing of the PrinceÕs. Anyway, the rest of 
the team mightÕve dealt with him before you get out of here, theyÕre 
not happy. . . .Ó There was a note of badly suppressed glee in RonÕs voice; Harry 
could tell he was nothing short 
of thrilled that McLaggen had 
messed up so badly. Harry lay there, 
staring up at the patch of light 
on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but 
feeling slightly tender unde
rneath all the bandaging. 
ÒI could hear the match commentary from here,Ó said Ron, his 
voice now shaking with laughter. 
ÒI hope Luna always commen-
tates from now on. . . . 
LoserÕs Lurgy
 . . .Ó 
But Harry was still too angry to 
see much humor in the situa-
tion, and after a while 
RonÕs snorts subsided. 
ÒGinny came in to visit while 
you were unconscious,Ó he said, 
after a long pause, and HarryÕs imag
ination zoomed into overdrive, 
rapidly constructing a scene in whic
h Ginny, weeping over his life-
less form, confessed her feelings of
 deep attraction to him while 
Ron gave them his blessing. . . . ÒS
he reckons you only just arrived 
on time for the match. How come
? You left here early enough.Ó 
ÒOh . . .Ó said Harry, as the sc
ene in his mindÕs eye imploded. 
ÒYeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy snea
king off with a couple of girls 
who didnÕt look like they wanted to
 be with him, and thatÕs the sec-
ond time heÕs made sure he isnÕt 
down on the Qui
dditch pitch with 
the rest of the school; he skippe
d the last match too, remember?Ó 
Harry sighed. ÒWish IÕd followed him now, the match was such a 
fiasco. . . .Ó 
ÒDonÕt be stupid,Ó said Ron sharply. ÒYou couldnÕt have missed a 
Quidditch match just to follow 
Malfoy, youÕre the Captain!Ó 
!#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 027" ÒI want to know what heÕs up to
,Ó said Harry. ÒAnd donÕt tell me 
itÕs all in my head, not after 
what I overheard between him and 
Snape ÑÓ 
ÒI never said it was all in your 
head,Ó said Ron, hoisting himself 
up on an elbow in turn and frowni
ng at Harry, Òbut thereÕs no rule 
saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this 
place! YouÕre gettin
g a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, 
thinking about missing a match 
just to follow him . . .Ó 
ÒI want to catch him at it!Ó sa
id Harry in frustration. ÒI mean, 
whereÕs he going when he 
disappears off the map?Ó 
ÒI dunno . . . Hogsmeade?Ó 
suggested Ron, yawning. 
ÒIÕve never seen him going along 
any of the secret passageways 
on the map. I though
t they were being watched now anyway?Ó 
ÒWell then, I dunno,Ó said Ron. 
Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamp-
light above him, 
thinking. . . . 
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour
Õs power, he would have been 
able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not 
have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleet-
ingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again 
was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of 
them, after all, still ha
d full schedules. . . . 
There was a low, rumbling snore 
from RonÕs bed. After a while 
Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick 
dressing gown. It was easiest to fe
ign sleep; Harry rolled over onto 
his side and listened to all the cu
rtains closing themselves as she 
waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, 
and she returned to her office; 
he heard the door click behind her 
and knew that she was off to bed. 
 '-.""&$*-/"
 02," This was, Harry reflected in the da
rkness, the third time that he 
had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch in-
jury. Last time he had fallen o
ff his broom due to the presence of 
dementors around the pitch, and th
e time before that, all the bones 
had been removed from his arm by
 the incurably inept Professor 
Lockhart. . . . That ha
d been his most painful injury by far . . . he 
remembered the agony of regrowin
g an armful of bones in one 
night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visi-
tor in the middle of the Ñ 
Harry sat bolt upright, his heart 
pounding, his bandage turban 
askew. He had the solution at last: There 
was a way to have Malfoy 
followed Ñ how could he have forgo
tten, why hadnÕt he thought of 
it before? 
But the question was, how to 
call him? What
 did you do? 
Quietly, tentatively, Har
ry spoke into the darkness. 
ÒKreacher?Ó 
There was a very loud 
crack, and the sounds of scuffling and 
squeaks filled the silent r
oom. Ron awoke with a yelp. 
ÒWhatÕs going Ñ ?Ó 
Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam PomfreyÕs 
office and muttered, Ò
Muffliato!Ó so that she would not come run-
ning. Then he scrambled to the end 
of his bed for a better look at 
what was going on. 
Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle 
of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and sev-
eral woolly hats, the other, a filthy
 old rag strung over his hips like a 
loincloth. Then there was another 
loud bang, and Peeves the Pol-
tergeist appeared in midair
 above the wrestling elves. 
 !#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 031" ÒI was watching that, Potty!Ó he
 told Harry indignantly, point-
ing at the fight below, before lett
ing out a loud cackle. ÒLook at the 
ickle creatures squabbling, bite
y bitey, punchy
 punchy ÑÓ 
ÒKreacher will not insult Harry 
Potter in front of Dobby, no he 
wonÕt, or Dobby will shut Kreach
erÕs mouth for him!Ó cried Dobby 
in a high-pitched voice. 
ÒÑ kicky, scratchy!Ó cried Peeves
 happily, now pelting bits of 
chalk at the elves to enrage them further. ÒTweaky, pokey!Ó 
ÒKreacher will say what he likes 
about his master, oh yes, and 
what a master he is, filthy fri
end of Mudbloods, oh, what would 
poor KreacherÕs mistress say Ñ ?Ó 
Exactly what KreacherÕs mistress
 would have said they did not 
find out, for at that moment Dobby 
sank his knobbly little fist into 
KreacherÕs mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and 
Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, 
though they continue
d to try and kick an
d punch each other, 
egged on by Peeves, who swooped
 around the lamp squealing, 
ÒStick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his 
earsies ÑÓ 
Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, Ò
Langlock!Ó Peeves 
clutched at his throat
, gulped, then swooped
 from the room mak-
ing obscene gestures but unable to 
speak, owing to the fact that his 
tongue had just glued itself 
to the roof of his mouth. 
ÒNice one,Ó said Ron appreciatively
, lifting Dobby into the air so 
that his flailing limbs no longer 
made contact with Kreacher. ÒThat 
was another Prince hex, wasnÕt it?Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry, twisting KreacherÕs wizened arm into a half 
nelson. ÒRight Ñ IÕm forbidding yo
u to fight each other! Well,  
 '-.""&$*-/"
 032" Kreacher, youÕre forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know IÕm not 
allowed to give 
you orders ÑÓ 
ÒDobby is a free house-elf and he
 can obey anyone he likes and 
Dobby will do whatever Harry Po
tter wants him to do!Ó said 
Dobby, tears now streamin
g down his shriveled li
ttle face onto his 
jumper. 
ÒOkay then,Ó said Harry, and he 
and Ron both released the elves, 
who fell to the floor but 
did not continue fighting. 
ÒMaster called me?Ó croaked Krea
cher, sinking into a bow even 
as he gave Harry a look that pl
ainly wished him a painful death. 
ÒYeah, I did,Ó said Harry, glan
cing toward Madam PomfreyÕs of-
fice door to check that the 
Muffliato spell was still working; there 
was no sign that she had heard 
any of the commotion. ÒIÕve got a 
job for you.Ó 
ÒKreacher will do whatever Master wants,Ó said Kreacher, sink-
ing so low that his lips almost 
touched his gnarled toes, Òbecause 
Kreacher has no choice, but Kreach
er is ashamed to have such a 
master, yes ÑÓ 
ÒDobby will do it, Harry Potter!Ó
 squeaked Dobby, his tennis-
ball-sized eyes still swimming in te
ars. ÒDobby would be honored to 
help Harry Potter!Ó 
ÒCome to think of it, it would 
be good to have 
both of you,Ó 
said Harry. ÒOkay then . . . I wa
nt you to tail Draco Malfoy.Ó 
Ignoring the look of mingled surp
rise and exasperation on RonÕs 
face, Harry went on, ÒI want to 
know where heÕs going, who heÕs 
meeting, and what heÕs doing. I wa
nt you to follow him around the 
clock.Ó 
ÒYes, Harry Potter!Ó said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining  
 !#$%&'("")*)'&'')"
 033" with excitement. ÒAnd if Dobby 
does it wrong, Dobby will throw 
himself off the topmost 
tower, Harry Potter!Ó 
ÒThere wonÕt be any 
need for that,Ó sa
id Harry hastily. 
ÒMaster wants me to follow th
e youngest of the Malfoys?Ó 
croaked Kreacher. ÒMaster wants 
me to spy upon the pure-blood 
great-nephew of my old mistress?Ó 
ÒThatÕs the one,Ó said Harry, fore
seeing a great danger and de-
termining to prevent it immediatel
y. ÒAnd youÕre forbidden to tip 
him off, Kreacher, or to show him what youÕre up to, or to talk to 
him at all, or to write him messages or . . . or to contact him in any 
way. Got it?Ó 
He thought he could see Kreacher 
struggling to see a loophole in 
the instructions he had just been 
given and waited. After a moment 
or two, and to HarryÕs great sati
sfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply 
again and said, with bitter resentment, ÒMaster thinks of every-
thing, and Kreacher must obey 
him even though Kreacher would 
much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes. . . .Ó 
ÒThatÕs settled, then,Ó said Harry. 
ÒIÕll want regular reports, but 
make sure IÕm not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron 
and Hermione are okay. And donÕt 
tell anyone what youÕre doing. 
Just stick to Malfoy like a 
couple of wart plasters.Ó

 arry and Ron left the hospital
 wing first thing on Mon-
day morning, restored to full health by the ministra-
tions of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of 
having been knocked out and poiso
ned, the best of which was that 
Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted 
them down to breakfast, bringing
 with her the news that Ginny 
had argued with Dean. The drowsing
 creature in HarryÕs chest sud-
denly raised its head, snif
fing the air hopefully. 
ÒWhat did they row about?Ó he aske
d, trying to sound casual as 
they turned onto a se
venth-floor corridor that
 was deserted but for 
a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tu-
tus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years 
and dropped the heavy brass 
scales she was carrying. 
ÒItÕs all right!Ó said Hermione ki
ndly, hurrying forward to help 
her. ÒHere . . .Ó 
 #"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,-," She tapped the broken scales 
with her wand and said, Ò
Reparo.Ó The girl did not say thank you, bu
t remained rooted to the spot 
as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back 
at her. 
ÒI swear theyÕre gettin
g smaller,Ó he said. 
ÒNever mind her,Ó said Harry, 
a little impatiently. ÒWhat did 
Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?Ó 
ÒOh, Dean was laughing about 
McLaggen hitting that Bludger 
at you,Ó said Hermione. 
ÒIt mustÕve looked funny,Ó said Ron reasonably. 
ÒIt didnÕt look funny at all!Ó sa
id Hermione hotly. ÒIt looked ter-
rible and if Coote and Peakes ha
dnÕt caught Harry he could have 
been very badly hurt!Ó 
ÒYeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up 
over it,Ó said Harry, still trying 
to sound casual. ÒOr are they still 
together?Ó 
ÒYes, they are Ñ but why are you so interested?Ó asked Hermi-
one, giving Harry a sharp look. 
ÒI just donÕt want my Quidditch 
team messed up again!Ó he said 
hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was 
most relieved when a voice behind them called, ÒHarry!Ó giving 
him an excuse to turn his back on her. 
ÒOh, hi, Luna.Ó 
ÒI went to the hospit
al wing to find you,Ó said Luna, rummag-
ing in her bag. ÒBut they said youÕd left. . . .Ó 
She thrust what appeared to be
 a green onion, a large spotted 
toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter 
into RonÕs hands, finally pulling ou
t a rather grubby scroll of parch-
ment that she handed to Harry. 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,-8" Ò. . . IÕve been told
 to give you this.Ó 
It was a small roll of parchment, 
which Harry recognized at once 
as another invitation to 
a lesson with Dumbledore. 
ÒTonight,Ó he told Ron and Herm
ione, once he had unrolled it. 
ÒNice commentary last match!Ó said Ron to Luna as she took 
back the green onion, the toadstool, 
and the cat litter. Luna smiled 
vaguely. 
ÒYouÕre making fun of me, arenÕt
 you?Ó she said. ÒEveryone says 
I was dreadful.Ó 
ÒNo, IÕm serious!Ó said Ron ear
nestly. ÒI canÕt remember enjoy-
ing commentary more! What is this
, by the way?Ó he added, hold-
ing the onionlike object up to eye level. 
ÒOh, itÕs a Gurdyroot,Ó she said, 
stuffing the cat litter and the 
toadstool back into her bag. ÒYou can 
keep it if you li
ke, IÕve got a few 
of them. TheyÕre really excellent 
for warding off Gulping Plimpies.Ó 
And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the 
Gurdyroot. 
ÒYou know, sheÕs grown on me, Luna,Ó he said, as they set off 
again for the Great Hall. ÒI know sh
eÕs insane, but itÕs in a good ÑÓ 
He stopped talking very sudden
ly. Lavender Brown was stand-
ing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. 
ÒHi,Ó said Ron nervously. 
ÒCÕmon,Ó Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, 
though not before they had heard 
Lavender say, ÒWhy didnÕt you 
tell me you were getting out today? And why was 
she with you?Ó 
Ron looked both sulky and anno
yed when he appeared at break-
fast half an hour later, and thou
gh he sat with Lavender, Harry did 
not see them exchange a word all 
the time they were together. Her-
mione was acting as though she wa
s quite oblivious to all of this, 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,-9" but once or twice Harry saw an inex
plicable smirk cross her face. All 
that day she seemed to be in a 
particularly good mood, and that 
evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in 
other words, finish writing) Ha
rryÕs Herbology essay, something 
she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she 
had known that Harry would th
en let Ron copy his work. 
ÒThanks a lot, Hermione,Ó said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on 
the back as he checked his watch 
and saw that it was nearly eight 
oÕclock. ÒListen, IÕve got to hurry or IÕll be late for Dumble-
dore. . . .Ó 
She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler 
sentences in a weary sort of wa
y. Grinning, Harry hurried out 
through the portrait hole and off 
to the headmasterÕs office. The 
gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee ”clairs, and Harry took 
the spiral staircase two steps at a ti
me, knocking on the door just as 
a clock within chimed eight. 
ÒEnter,Ó called Dumbledore, bu
t as Harry put out a hand to 
push the door, it was wrenched op
en from inside. There stood Pro-
fessor Trelawney. 
ÒAha!Ó she cried, pointing dram
atically at Harry 
as she blinked 
at him through her magnifying spec
tacles. ÒSo this is the reason I 
am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!Ó 
ÒMy dear Sybill,Ó said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated 
voice, Òthere is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from 
anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really donÕt 
think there is any more to be said ÑÓ 
ÒVery well,Ó said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded 
voice. ÒIf you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. . . .  
 /0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,-:" Perhaps I shall find a school wher
e my talents are better appreci-
ated. . . .Ó 
She pushed past Harry and disa
ppeared down the spiral stair-
case; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that 
she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls. 
ÒPlease close the door and sit down, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore, 
sounding rather tired. 
Harry obeyed, noticing as he took
 his usual seat in front of 
DumbledoreÕs desk that the Pensie
ve lay between them once more, 
as did two more tiny crystal bo
ttles full of swirling memory. ÒProfessor Trelawney still isnÕt ha
ppy Firenze is teaching, then?Ó 
Harry asked. 
ÒNo,Ó said Dumbledore, ÒDivination is turning out to be much 
more trouble than I could have fo
reseen, never having studied the 
subject myself. I cannot ask Firenz
e to return to the forest, where 
he is now an outcast, nor can I as
k Sybill Trelawney to leave. Be-
tween ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in out-
side the castle. She does not kn
ow Ñ and I think it would be 
unwise to enlighten her Ñ that she made the prophecy about you 
and Voldemort, you see.Ó 
Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, 
then said, ÒBut never mind my 
staffing problems. We have much
 more important matters to dis-
cuss. Firstly Ñ have you managed th
e task I set you at the end of 
our previous lesson?Ó 
ÒAh,Ó said Harry, brought up sh
ort. What with Apparition 
lessons and Quidditch and Ron bein
g poisoned and getting his skull 
cracked and his determination to 
find out what Draco Malfoy was 
up to, Harry had almost forgo
tten about the memory Dumbledore  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,-;" had asked him to extract from Pr
ofessor Slughorn. ÒWell, I asked 
Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he 
wouldnÕt give it to me.Ó 
There was a little silence. 
ÒI see,Ó said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the 
top of his half-moon spectacles 
and giving Harry 
the usual sensa-
tion that he was being X-rayed. ÒA
nd you feel that you have exerted 
your very best efforts in this ma
tter, do you? That you have exer-
cised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth 
of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?Ó 
ÒWell,Ó Harry stalled, at a loss for 
what to say next. His single at-
tempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly 
feeble. ÒWell . . . the day Ron swa
llowed love potion by mistake I 
took him to Professor Slughorn. I 
thought maybe if I got Professor 
Slughorn in a good enough mood ÑÓ 
ÒAnd did that work?Ó asked Dumbledore. 
ÒWell, no, sir, becaus
e Ron got poisoned ÑÓ 
ÒÑ which, naturally, made you forg
et all about trying to retrieve 
the memory; I would have expected
 nothing else, while your best 
friend was in danger. Once it be
came clear that Mr. Weasley was 
going to make a full recovery, ho
wever, I would have hoped that 
you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you 
how very important that memory is
. Indeed, I did my best to im-
press upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we 
will be wasting our time without it.Ó 
A hot, prickly feeling of shame 
spread from the top of HarryÕs 
head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his 
voice, he did not even sound an
gry, but Harry would have preferred 
him to yell; this cold disappoin
tment was worse than anything. 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,-<" ÒSir,Ó he said, a little desperately,
 Òit isnÕt that I wasnÕt bothered 
or anything, IÕve just had other Ñ other things . . .Ó 
ÒOther things on your mind,Ó
 Dumbledore finished the sen-
tence for him. ÒI see.Ó 
Silence fell between them again, 
the most uncomfortable silence 
Harry had ever experienced with Du
mbledore; it seemed to go on 
and on, punctuated only by the li
ttle grunting snor
es of the por-
trait of Armando Dippet over 
DumbledoreÕs head. Harry felt 
strangely diminished, as though he 
had shrunk a little since he had 
entered the room. When he could st
and it no longer
 he said, ÒPro-
fessor Dumbledore, IÕm really sorry.
 I should have done more. . . . 
I should have realized you wouldnÕt have asked me to do it if it 
wasnÕt really important.Ó 
ÒThank you for saying that, Ha
rry,Ó said Dumbledore quietly. 
ÒMay I hope, then, that you will 
give this matter higher priority 
from now on? There will be little 
point in our meeting after tonight 
unless we have that memory.Ó 
ÒIÕll do it, sir, IÕll get it fr
om him,Ó he said earnestly. 
ÒThen we shall say no more abou
t it just now,Ó said Dumbledore 
more kindly, Òbut continue with our story where we left off. You re-
member where that was?Ó 
ÒYes, sir,Ó said Harry quickly. ÒV
oldemort killed his father and 
his grandparents and made it look 
as though his Uncle Morfin did 
it. Then he went back 
to Hogwarts and he asked . . . he asked Pro-
fessor Slughorn about Horcruxes,Ó he mumbled shamefacedly. 
ÒVery good,Ó said Dumbledore.
 ÒNow, you will remember, I 
hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that 
we would be entering the realms
 of guesswork and speculation?Ó 
ÒYes, sir.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,.=" ÒThus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm 
sources of fact for my deductions
 as to what Voldemort did until 
the age of seventeen?Ó 
Harry nodded. 
ÒBut now, Harry,Ó said Dumble
dore, Ònow things become 
murkier and stranger. If it was di
fficult to find evidence about the 
boy Riddle, it has been almost im
possible to find anyone prepared 
to reminisce about the man Voldem
ort. In fact, I doubt whether 
there is a soul alive, apart from hi
mself, who could give us a full ac-
count of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last 
memories that I would like to share with you.Ó Dumbledore indi-
cated the two little crystal bottles 
gleaming beside the Pensieve. ÒI 
shall then be glad of your opinio
n as to whether the conclusions 
I have drawn from them seem likely.Ó 
The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made 
Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task 
of retrieving the Horc
rux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his 
seat as Dumbledore raised the firs
t of the two bottles to the light 
and examined it. 
ÒI hope you are not tired of divi
ng into other peopleÕs memories, 
for they are curious recollections,
 these two,Ó he said. ÒThis first 
one came from a very old house-el
f by the name of Hokey. Before 
we see what Hokey witnessed, I 
must quickly recount how Lord 
Voldemort left Hogwarts. 
ÒHe reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might 
have expected, top grades in ever
y examination he had taken. All 
around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to 
pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected 
spectacular things from Tom Riddle
, prefect, Head Boy, winner of 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,.>" the Award for Special Services to 
the School. I know that several 
teachers, Professor Slughorn amongs
t them, suggested that he join 
the Ministry of Magic, offered to
 set up appointments, put him in 
touch with useful contacts. He refu
sed all offers. The next thing the 
staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.Ó 
ÒAt Borgin and Burkes?Ó Harry repeated, stunned. 
ÒAt Borgin and Burkes,Ó repeat
ed Dumbledore calmly. ÒI think 
you will see what attractions the 
place held for him when we have 
entered HokeyÕs memory. But this 
was not VoldemortÕs first choice 
of job. Hardly anyone knew of it
 at the time Ñ I was one of the 
few in whom the then headmaster
 confided Ñ but Voldemort first 
approached Professor Dippet and 
asked whether he could remain 
at Hogwarts as a teacher.Ó 
ÒHe wanted to stay here? Why?Ó 
asked Harry, more amazed still. 
ÒI believe he had several reason
s, though he confided none of 
them to Professor Dippet,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒFirstly, and very 
importantly, Voldemort was, I believ
e, more attached 
to this school 
than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been 
happiest; the first 
and only place he 
had felt at home.Ó 
Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at
 these words, for this was ex-
actly how he felt about Hogwarts too. 
ÒSecondly, the castle is a strong
hold of ancient magic. Undoubt-
edly Voldemort had penetrated many 
more of its secrets than most 
of the students who pass through th
e place, but he may have felt 
that there were
 still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. 
ÒAnd thirdly, as a teacher, he 
would have had great power and in-
fluence over young witches and wiza
rds. Perhaps he had gained the 
idea from Professor Slughorn, th
e teacher with whom he was on 
best terms, who had demonstrated 
how influential a role a teacher 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,.-" can play. I do not imagine for an 
instant that Voldemort envisaged 
spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw 
it as a useful recruiting ground
, and a place wher
e he might begin 
to build himself an army.Ó 
ÒBut he didnÕt get the job, sir?Ó 
ÒNo, he did not. Professor Dipp
et told him that he was too 
young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he 
still wished to teach.Ó 
ÒHow did you feel about that, sir?Ó asked Harry hesitantly. 
ÒDeeply uneasy,Ó said Dumble
dore. ÒI had advised Armando 
against the appointment Ñ I did not give the reasons I have given 
you, for Professor Dippet was ve
ry fond of Voldemort and con-
vinced of his honesty. But I did no
t want Lord Voldemort back at 
this school, and especially not in a position of power.Ó 
ÒWhich job did he want, sir? 
What subject did he want to 
teach?Ó 
Somehow, Harry knew the answ
er even before Dumbledore 
gave it. 
ÒDefense Against the Dark Arts. It 
was being taught at the time 
by an old Professor by the name
 of Galatea Merrythought, who 
had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years. 
ÒSo Voldemort went off to Borgin
 and Burkes, and all the staff 
who had admired him said what a 
waste it was, a brilliant young 
wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no 
mere assistant. Polite and handso
me and clever, he was soon given 
particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and 
Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with un-
usual and powerful properties. Vo
ldemort was sent to persuade  
 /0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,.." people to part with their treasure
s for sale by the partners, and he 
was, by all accounts, unusua
lly gifted at doing this.Ó 
ÒIÕll bet he was,Ó said Harry,
 unable to contain himself. 
ÒWell, quite,Ó said Dumbledore, wi
th a faint smile. ÒAnd now it 
is time to hear from Hokey the 
house-elf, who worked for a very 
old, very rich wi
tch by the name of
 Hepzibah Smith.Ó 
Dumbledore tapped a bottle with 
his wand, the cork flew out, 
and he tipped the swirling memory 
into the Pensieve, saying as he 
did so, ÒAfter you, Harry.Ó 
Harry got to his feet and bent once 
more over the rippling silver 
contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tum-
bled through dark nothingness an
d landed in a sitting room in 
front of an immensely fat old lady
 wearing an elaborate ginger wig 
and a brilliant pink set of robes th
at flowed all around her, giving 
her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small 
jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge 
onto her alread
y scarlet cheeks 
with a large powder puff, while 
the tiniest and oldest house-elf 
Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy
 feet into tight satin slippers. 
ÒHurry up, Hokey!Ó said Hepzibah imperiously. ÒHe said heÕd 
come at four, itÕs only a couple of minutes to and heÕs never been 
late yet!Ó 
She tucked away her powder puff 
as the house-elf straightened 
up. The top of the elfÕs head barely
 reached the seat of HepzibahÕs 
chair, and her papery skin hung o
ff her frame just like the crisp 
linen sheet she wore 
draped like a toga. 
ÒHow do I look?Ó said Hepzibah, 
turning her head to admire the 
various angles of her face in the mirror. 
ÒLovely, madam,Ó squeaked Hokey. 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,.," Harry could only assume that it
 was down in HokeyÕs contract 
that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, be-
cause Hepzibah Smith looked a 
long way from lovely in his 
opinion. A tinkling doorbell rang and 
both mistress and elf jumped. 
ÒQuick, quick, heÕs here, Hokey!Ó cried Hepzibah and the elf 
scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that 
it was difficult to see how anybod
y could navigate 
their way across 
it without knocking over at leas
t a dozen things: There were cabi-
nets full of little la
cquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed 
books, shelves of orbs and celest
ial globes, and many flourishing 
potted plants in brass containers. 
In fact, the room looked like a 
cross between a magical antiqu
e shop and a 
conservatory. 
The house-elf returned within minu
tes, followed by a tall young 
man Harry had no difficulty what
soever in recognizing as Volde-
mort. He was plainly dressed in a 
black suit; his ha
ir was a little 
longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but 
all of this suited him; he look
ed more handsome than ever. He 
picked his way through the cramped 
room with an air that showed 
he had visited many times before
 and bowed low over HepzibahÕs 
fat little hand, brushi
ng it with
 his lips. 
ÒI brought you flowers,Ó he said quietly, producing a bunch of 
roses from nowhere. 
ÒYou naughty boy, you shouldnÕt 
have!Ó squealed old Hepzibah, 
though Harry noticed that she had 
an empty vase standing ready 
on the nearest little table. ÒYou do 
spoil this old lady, Tom. . . . Sit 
down, sit down. . . . Wher
eÕs Hokey? Ah . . .Ó 
The house-elf had come dashing 
back into the room carrying a 
tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistressÕs elbow. 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,.8" ÒHelp yourself, Tom,Ó said Hepzib
ah, ÒI know how you love my 
cakes. Now, how are you? You look 
pale. They overwork you at that 
shop, IÕve said it a 
hundred times. . . .Ó 
Voldemort smiled mechanical
ly and Hepzibah simpered. 
ÒWell, whatÕs your excuse for visi
ting this time?Ó she asked, bat-
ting her lashes. 
ÒMr. Burke would like to make 
an improved offer for the gob-
lin-made armor,Ó said Voldemort. 
ÒFive hundred Galleons, he feels 
it is a more than fair ÑÓ 
ÒNow, now, not so fast, or IÕll t
hink youÕre only here for my trin-
kets!Ó pouted Hepzibah. 
ÒI am ordered here because of th
em,Ó said Voldemort quietly. ÒI 
am only a poor assistant, madam,
 who must do as he is told. Mr. 
Burke wishes me to inquire ÑÓ 
ÒOh, Mr. Burke, phooey!Ó said 
Hepzibah, waving a little hand. 
ÒIÕve something to show you that 
IÕve never shown Mr. Burke! Can 
you keep a secret, Tom? Will you 
promise you wonÕt tell Mr. Burke 
IÕve got it? HeÕd never let me rest 
if he knew IÕd shown it to you, 
and IÕm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, 
youÕll appreciate it for its history,
 not how many Galleons you can 
get for it.Ó 
ÒIÕd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,Ó said 
Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. 
ÒI had Hokey bring it out for me. . . . Hokey, where are you? I 
want to show Mr. Riddle our 
finest
 treasure. . . . In fact, bring both, 
while youÕre at it. . . .Ó 
ÒHere, madam,Ó squeaked the 
house-elf, and Harry saw two 
leather boxes, one on top of the ot
her, moving across the room as if 
of their own volition, though he
 knew the tiny elf was holding 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,.9" them over her head as she wend
ed her way between tables, pouffes, 
and footstools. 
ÒNow,Ó said Hepzibah happily, 
taking the boxes from the elf, 
laying them in her lap, and prepar
ing to open the topmost one, ÒI 
think youÕll like this, Tom. . . . Oh
, if my family knew I was show-
ing you. . . . They canÕt wait 
to get their hands on this!Ó 
She opened the lid. Harry edged fo
rward a little to get a better 
view and saw what looked like 
a small golden cup with two finely 
wrought handles. 
ÒI wonder whether you know what 
it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a 
good look!Ó whispered Hepzibah, 
and Voldemort stretched out a 
long-fingered hand and lifted the cu
p by one handle out of its snug 
silken wrappings. Harry thought he
 saw a red gleam in his dark 
eyes. His greedy expression was cu
riously mirrored on HepzibahÕs 
face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon VoldemortÕs hand-
some features. 
ÒA badger,Ó murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving 
upon the cup. ÒThen 
this was . . . ?Ó ÒHelga HufflepuffÕs, as you very well know, you clever boy!Ó said 
Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and ac-
tually pinching his hollow cheek. 
ÒDidnÕt I tell you I was distantly 
descended? This has been handed dow
n in the family for years and 
years. Lovely, isnÕt it? And all sort
s of powers itÕs supposed to pos-
sess too, but I havenÕt tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice 
and safe in here. . . .Ó 
She hooked the cup back off Vold
emortÕs long forefinger and re-
stored it gently to its box, too inte
nt upon settling it carefully back 
into position to notice the shadow
 that crossed VoldemortÕs face as 
the cup was 
taken away. 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,.:" ÒNow then,Ó said Hepzibah happ
ily, ÒwhereÕs Hokey? Oh yes, 
there you are Ñ take that away now, Hokey.Ó 
The elf obediently took the bo
xed cup, and Hepzibah turned 
her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. 
ÒI think youÕll like this even mo
re, Tom,Ó she whispered. ÒLean 
in a little, dear boy, so you can se
e. . . . Of course, Burke knows IÕve 
got this one, I bought it from him,
 and I daresay heÕd love to get it 
back when IÕm gone. . . .Ó 
She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. 
There upon the smooth crimson ve
lvet lay a heavy golden locket. 
Voldemort reached out his hand, 
without invitation this time, 
and held it up to the light, staring at it. 
ÒSlytherinÕs mark,Ó he said quietly, as the light played upon an 
ornate, serpentine 
S. ÒThatÕs right!Ó said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight 
of Voldemort gazing at her locket, 
transfixed. ÒI had to pay an arm 
and a leg for it, but I couldnÕt let it 
pass, not a real treasure like that, 
had to have it for my collection. 
Burke bought it, apparently, from 
a ragged-looking woman who seemed 
to have stolen it, but had no 
idea of its true value ÑÓ 
There was no mistaking it this 
time: VoldemortÕs eyes flashed 
scarlet at the words, and Harry 
saw his knuckles whiten on the 
locketÕs chain. 
ÒÑ I daresay Burke paid her a pi
ttance but there you are. . . . 
Pretty, isnÕt it? And again, all ki
nds of powers attributed to it, 
though I just keep it 
nice and safe. . . .Ó She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry 
thought Voldemort was not going to 
let go of it, but then it had 
slid through his finger
s and was back in its 
red velvet cushion. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,.;" ÒSo there you are, Tom, dear, 
and I hope you enjoyed that!Ó 
She looked him full in the face 
and for the first time, Harry saw 
her foolish smile falter. 
ÒAre you all right, dear?Ó 
ÒOh yes,Ó said Voldemort quietly.
 ÒYes, IÕm very
 well. . . .Ó 
ÒI thought Ñ but a trick of the 
light, I suppose ÑÓ said Hepzi-
bah, looking unnerved, and Harry 
guessed that sh
e too had seen 
the momentary red gleam in VoldemortÕs eyes. ÒHere, Hokey, take 
these away and lock them up 
again. . . . Th
e usual enchant-
ments . . .Ó 
ÒTime to leave, Harry,Ó said Dumb
ledore quietly, and as the lit-
tle elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry 
once again above the elbow and to
gether they rose up through 
oblivion and back to
 DumbledoreÕs office. 
ÒHepzibah Smith died two days 
after that little scene,Ó said 
Dumbledore, resuming his seat an
d indicating that Harry should 
do the same. ÒHokey the house-el
f was convicted by the Ministry 
of poisoning her mistressÕs evening cocoa by accident.Ó 
ÒNo way!Ó said Harry angrily. 
ÒI see we are of one mind,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒCertainly, there 
are many similarities between this 
death and that of
 the Riddles. In 
both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a 
clear memory of having 
caused the death ÑÓ 
ÒHokey confessed?Ó 
ÒShe remembered putting somethin
g in her mistressÕs cocoa that 
turned out not to be sugar, but a 
lethal and little-known poison,Ó 
said Dumbledore. ÒIt was conclude
d that she had not meant to do 
it, but being old and confused ÑÓ 
 /0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,.<" ÒVoldemort modified her memory, ju
st like he did with Morfin!Ó 
ÒYes, that is my conclusion too,
Ó said Dumbledore. ÒAnd, just as 
with Morfin, the Ministry was pr
edisposed to suspect Hokey ÑÓ 
ÒÑ because she was a house-elf,Ó 
said Harry. He had rarely felt 
more in sympathy with the societ
y Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. 
ÒPrecisely,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒShe was old, she admitted to 
having tampered with the drink, 
and nobody at the Ministry both-
ered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I 
traced her and managed to extract 
this memory, her life was almost 
over Ñ but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that 
Voldemort knew of the existenc
e of the cup and the locket. 
ÒBy the time Hokey was convicted,
 HepzibahÕs family had real-
ized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a 
while to be sure of this, for she 
had many hiding pl
aces, having al-
ways guarded her collection most je
alously. But before they were 
sure beyond doubt that the cup an
d the locket were both gone, the 
assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man 
who had visited Hepzib
ah so regularly and charmed her so well, 
had resigned his post
 and vanished. His su
periors had no idea 
where he had gone; they were as 
surprised as anyone at his disap-
pearance. And that was the last th
at was seen or heard of Tom Rid-
dle for a very long time. 
ÒNow,Ó said Dumbledore, Òif yo
u donÕt mind, Harry, I want to 
pause once more to draw your at
tention to certain points of our 
story. Voldemort had committed 
another murder; whether it was 
his first since he killed the Riddl
es, I do not know, but I think it 
was. This time, as you will have se
en, he killed not for revenge, but 
for gain. He wanted the two fabulo
us trophies that poor, besotted,  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,,=" old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other chil-
dren at his orphanage, just as he 
had stolen his Uncle MorfinÕs ring, 
so he ran off now with He
pzibahÕs cup and locket.Ó 
ÒBut,Ó said Harry, frowning, Òit 
seems mad. . . . Risking every-
thing, throwing away his jo
b, just for those . . .Ó 
ÒMad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,Ó said Dumble-
dore. ÒI hope you will understand 
in due course exactly what those 
objects meant to him, Harry, but yo
u must admit that it is not dif-
ficult to imagine that he
 saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.Ó 
ÒThe locket maybe,Ó said Harry, 
Òbut why take the cup as well?Ó 
ÒIt had belonged to another of 
HogwartsÕs founders,Ó said Dum-
bledore. ÒI think he still felt a grea
t pull toward the school and that 
he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There 
were other reasons, I think. . . . 
I hope to be able to demonstrate 
them to you in due course. 
ÒAnd now for the very last recollect
ion I have to show you, at least 
until you manage to retrieve Pr
ofessor SlughornÕs memory for us. 
Ten years separates HokeyÕs memory 
and this one, ten years during 
which we can only guess at what 
Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .Ó 
Harry got to his feet once more 
as Dumbledore emptied the last 
memory into the Pensieve. 
ÒWhose memory is it?Ó he asked. 
ÒMine,Ó said Dumbledore. 
And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver 
mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes 
slumbering happily on his perch,
 and there behind the desk was 
Dumbledore, who looked very simi
lar to the Dumbledore standing 
beside Harry, though both hand
s were whole and undamaged and 
his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,,>" the present-day office and this on
e was that it was snowing in the 
past; bluish flecks were drifting 
past the window in the dark and 
building up on the outside ledge. 
The younger Dumbledore seemed to
 be waiting for something, 
and sure enough, moment
s after their arrival, there was a knock on 
the door and he 
said, ÒEnter.Ó 
Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the 
room. His features were not thos
e Harry had seen emerge from the 
great stone cauldron almost two ye
ars ago: They were not as snake-
like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet 
he was no longer handsome Tom Ri
ddle. It was as though his fea-
tures had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly dis-
torted, and the whites of the ey
es now had a permanently bloody 
look, though the pupils were not 
yet the slits that Harry knew they 
would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was 
as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders. 
The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. 
Evidently this visi
t had been made 
by appointment. 
ÒGood evening, Tom,Ó said Dumble
dore easily. ÒWonÕt you sit 
down?Ó ÒThank you,Ó said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which 
Dumbledore had gestured Ñ the very 
seat, by the looks of it, that 
Harry had just vacated in the pres
ent. ÒI heard that you had be-
come headmaster,Ó he said, and 
his voice was slightly higher and 
colder than it had been. ÒA worthy choice.Ó 
ÒI am glad you approve,Ó said 
Dumbledore, smiling. ÒMay I of-
fer you a drink?Ó 
ÒThat would be welcome,Ó said Vo
ldemort. ÒI have come a long 
way.Ó !#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,,-" Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now 
kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having 
handed Voldemort a goblet of wi
ne and poured one 
for himself, he 
returned to the seat behind his desk. 
ÒSo, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?Ó 
Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine. 
ÒThey do not call me ÔTomÕ anymore,Ó he said. ÒThese days, I 
am known as ÑÓ 
ÒI know what you are known as
,Ó said Dumbledore, smiling 
pleasantly. ÒBut to me, IÕm afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. 
It is one of the irritating things 
about old teachers. 
I am afraid that 
they never quite forget their chargesÕ youthful beginnings.Ó 
He raised his glass as though to
asting Voldemort, whose face re-
mained expressionless. Nevertheless
, Harry felt the atmosphere in 
the room change subtly: DumbledoreÕs refusal to use VoldemortÕs 
chosen name was a refusal to allo
w Voldemort to dictate the terms 
of the meeting, and Ha
rry could tell that Voldemort took it as 
such. ÒI am surprised you have remain
ed here so long,Ó said Volde-
mort after a short pause. ÒI always wondered why a wizard such as 
yourself never wished to leave school.Ó 
ÒWell,Ó said Dumbledore, still smiling, Òto a wizard such as my-
self, there can be nothing more im
portant than passing on ancient 
skills, helping hone yo
ung minds. If I reme
mber correctly, you 
once saw the attraction of teaching too.Ó 
ÒI see it still,Ó said Voldemort. ÒI merely wondered why you Ñ 
who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have 
twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister ÑÓ 
 /0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,,." ÒThree times at the last count, ac
tually,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒBut 
the Ministry never attracted me as
 a career. Again, something we 
have in common, I think.Ó 
Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of 
wine. Dumbledore did not break the 
silence that stretched between 
them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for 
Voldemort to talk first. 
ÒI have returned,Ó he said, after 
a little while, Òlater, perhaps, 
than Professor Dippet expected . 
. . but I have returned, neverthe-
less, to request again what he once
 told me I was too young to have. 
I have come to you to ask that you 
permit me to return to this cas-
tle, to teach. I think you must 
know that I have seen and done 
much since I left this place. I 
could show and tell your students 
things they can gain fr
om no other wizard.Ó 
Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own gob-
let for a while before speaking. 
ÒYes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much 
since leaving us,Ó he said quietly. ÒRumors of your doings have 
reached your old school, Tom. I sh
ould be sorry to believe half of 
them.Ó VoldemortÕs expression remained 
impassive as he said, ÒGreat-
ness inspires envy, envy engender
s spite, spite spawns lies. You 
must know this, Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒYou call it Ôgreatness,Õ what you have been doing, do you?Ó 
asked Dumbledore delicately. 
ÒCertainly,Ó said Voldemort, and hi
s eyes seemed to burn red. ÒI 
have experimented; I have pushed 
the boundaries of magic further, 
perhaps, than they have
 ever been pushed ÑÓ 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,,," ÒOf some kinds of magic,Ó Dumbledore corrected him quietly. 
ÒOf some. Of others, you remain 
. . . forgive me . . . woefully 
ignorant.Ó 
For the first time, Voldemort smiled
. It was a taut leer, an evil 
thing, more threatening than a look of rage. 
ÒThe old argument,Ó he said softly. ÒBut nothing I have seen in 
the world has supported your famous
 pronouncements that love is 
more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒPerhaps you have been looking 
in the wrong places,Ó suggested 
Dumbledore. ÒWell, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than 
here, at Hogwarts?Ó said Voldemor
t. ÒWill you let me return? Will 
you let me share my knowledge with
 your students? I place myself 
and my talents at yo
ur disposal. I am 
yours to command.Ó 
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. ÒAnd what will become of 
those whom 
you command? What will ha
ppen to those who call 
themselves Ñ or so rumor has it Ñ the Death Eaters?Ó 
Harry could tell that Voldemor
t had not expected Dumbledore 
to know this name; he saw Voldem
ortÕs eyes flash red again and the 
slitlike nostrils flare. 
ÒMy friends,Ó he said, after a 
momentÕs pause, Òwill carry on 
without me, I am sure.Ó 
ÒI am glad to hear that you co
nsider them friends,Ó said Dum-
bledore. ÒI was under the impression
 that they are more in the or-
der of servants.Ó 
ÒYou are mistaken,Ó
 said Voldemort. 
ÒThen if I were to go to the HogÕ
s Head tonight, I would not find 
a group of them Ñ Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov Ñ awaiting 
your return? Devoted friends indeed, 
to travel this far with you on 
/0(1""20/1'30(&45"
('67'5&" ,,8" a snowy night, merely to wish you 
luck as you attempted to secure 
a teaching post.Ó 
There could be no doubt that DumbledoreÕs detailed knowledge 
of those with whom he was trav
eling was even less welcome to 
Voldemort; however, he 
rallied almost
 at once. 
ÒYou are omniscient as
 ever, Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒOh no, merely friendly with 
the local barmen,Ó said Dumble-
dore lightly. ÒNow, Tom . . .Ó 
Dumbledore set down hi
s empty glass and dr
ew himself up in 
his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic 
gesture. 
ÒLet us speak openly. Why have
 you come here tonight, sur-
rounded by henchmen, to request 
a job we both 
know you do not 
want?Ó Voldemort looked coldly surpri
sed. ÒA job I do not want? On 
the contrary, Dumbledore, 
I want it very much.Ó 
ÒOh, you want to come back to
 Hogwarts, but you do not want 
to teach any more than you want
ed to when you were eighteen. 
What is it youÕre after, Tom? Wh
y not try an open request for once?Ó Voldemort sneered. ÒIf you do no
t want to give me a job ÑÓ 
ÒOf course I donÕt,Ó said Dumble
dore. ÒAnd I donÕt think for a 
moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you 
asked, you must ha
ve had a purpose.Ó 
Voldemort stood up. He looked le
ss like Tom Riddle than ever, 
his features thick with rage. 
ÒThis is your final word?Ó 
ÒIt is,Ó said Dumble
dore, also standing. 
ÒThen we have nothing more
 to say to each other.Ó 
ÒNo, nothing,Ó said Dumbledore, 
and a great sadness filled his 
face. ÒThe time is long gone when I could frighten you with a 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+"
 ,,9" burning wardrobe and force you 
to make repayment for your 
crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. . . . I wi
sh I could. . . .Ó 
For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless 
warning: He was sure that VoldemortÕs hand had twitched toward 
his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Volde-
mort had turned away
, the door was closing, and 
he was gone. 
Harry felt DumbledoreÕs hand clos
e over his arm again and mo-
ments later, they were standing to
gether on almost the same spot, 
but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dum-
bledoreÕs hand was blackened 
and dead-looking
 once more. 
ÒWhy?Ó said Harry at once, look
ing up into DumbledoreÕs face. 
ÒWhy did he come back? 
Did you ever find out?Ó 
ÒI have ideas,Ó said Dumbledore, Òbut no more than that.Ó 
ÒWhat ideas, sir?Ó 
ÒI shall tell you, Harry, when 
you have retrieved that memory 
from Professor Slughorn,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWhen you have that 
last piece of the jigsaw
, everything will, I hope, 
be clear . . . to both 
of us.Ó Harry was still burning with cu
riosity and even though Dum-
bledore had walked to 
the door and was holdin
g it open for him, 
he did not move at once. 
ÒWas he after the Defense Against 
the Dark Arts job again, sir? 
He didnÕt say. . . .Ó 
ÒOh, he definitely wanted th
e Defense Against the Dark Arts 
job,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒThe aftermath of our little meeting 
proved that. You see, we have ne
ver been able to keep a Defense 
Against the Dark Arts teacher for lo
nger than a year since I refused 
the post to Lord Voldemort.Ó 
!"#"$"%"&"'"(""&")"'"*"&"+","-"*"'"
""../" &#'"0*1*-)$23'"(--4"
   arry wracked his brains
 over the next week as to how he 
was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true mem-
ory, but nothing in the nature of
 a brain wave occurred and he was 
reduced to doing what 
he did increasingly th
ese days when at a 
loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would 
have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so 
many times before. 
ÒYou wonÕt find anything in there,Ó said Hermione firmly, late 
on Sunday evening. 
ÒDonÕt start, Hermione,Ó said 
Harry. ÒIf it hadnÕt been for the 
Prince, Ron wouldnÕt be
 sitting here now.Ó 
ÒHe would if youÕd just listened to
 Snape in our first year,Ó said 
Hermione dismissively. 
Harry ignored her. He had ju
st found an incantation (Ò
Sectum-
sempra
!Ó) scrawled in a ma
rgin above the intrig
uing words ÒFor  
 #"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 ..5" Enemies,Ó and was itching 
to try it out, but thought it best not to 
in front of Hermione. Instead, he
 surreptitiously folded down the 
corner of the page. 
They were sitting beside the fire
 in the common 
room; the only 
other people awake were fellow si
xth years. There had been a cer-
tain amount of excitement earlie
r when they had come back from 
dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the 
date for their Apparition Test. 
Those who would be
 seventeen on 
or before the first test date, the tw
enty-first of April, had the option 
of signing up for additional prac
tice sessions, which would take 
place (heavily superv
ised) in Hogsmeade. 
Ron had panicked on reading this
 notice; he had still not man-
aged to Apparate and feared he 
would not be ready for the test. 
Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little 
more confident, but Harry, who 
would not be seventeen for an-
other four months, could not take 
the test whether ready or not. 
ÒAt least you can Apparate, though!Ó said Ron tensely. ÒYouÕll 
have no trouble come July!Ó 
ÒIÕve only done it on
ce,Ó Harry reminded 
him; he had finally 
managed to disappear 
and rematerialize insi
de his hoop during 
their previous lesson. 
Having wasted a lot of time wo
rrying aloud about Apparition, 
Ron was now struggling to finish
 a viciously difficult essay for 
Snape that Harry an
d Hermione had alre
ady completed. Harry 
fully expected to receive low mark
s on his, because he had disagreed 
with Snape on the best way to ta
ckle dementors, but he did not 
care: SlughornÕs memory was the mo
st important thing to him now. 
ÒIÕm telling you, the stupid Prince isnÕt going to be able to help 
you with this, Harry!Ó said Hermio
ne, more loudly. ÒThereÕs only 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" ..6" one way to force someone to do wh
at you want, and thatÕs the Im-
perius Curse, which is illegal ÑÓ 
ÒYeah, I know that, thanks,Ó said
 Harry, not looking up from the 
book. ÒThatÕs why IÕm looking for something different. Dumble-
dore says Veritaserum wonÕt do it, but there might be something 
else, a potion or 
a spell. . . .Ó 
ÒYouÕre going about it the wrong way,Ó said Hermione. ÒOnly 
you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you 
can persuade Slughorn where other pe
ople canÕt. ItÕs not a question 
of slipping him a potion, 
anyone could do that ÑÓ 
ÒHow dÕyou spell ÔbelligerentÕ?Ó sa
id Ron, shaking his quill very 
hard while staring at his parchm
ent. ÒIt canÕt be B Ñ U Ñ M ÑÓ 
ÒNo, it isnÕt,Ó said Hermione, 
pulling RonÕs essay toward her. 
ÒAnd ÔauguryÕ doesnÕt begin O 
Ñ R Ñ G either. What kind of 
quill are you using?Ó 
ÒItÕs one of Fred and GeorgeÕs Spell-Check ones . . . but I think 
the charm must be wearing off. . . .Ó 
ÒYes, it must,Ó said Hermione, poin
ting at the title of his essay, 
Òbecause we were asked how weÕd 
deal with dementors, not ÔDug-
bogs,Õ and I donÕt remember you 
changing your name to ÔRoonil 
WazlibÕ either.Ó 
ÒAh no!Ó said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. 
ÒDonÕt say IÕll have to writ
e the whole thing out again!Ó 
ÒItÕs okay, we can fix it,Ó said 
Hermione, pulling the essay toward 
her and taking out her wand. 
ÒI love you, Hermione,Ó said Ron,
 sinking back in his chair, rub-
bing his eyes wearily. 
Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, ÒDonÕt let 
Lavender hear you saying that.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .78" ÒI wonÕt,Ó said Ron into his hands. ÒOr maybe I will . . . then 
sheÕll ditch me . . .Ó 
ÒWhy donÕt you ditch her if you wa
nt to finish it?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒYou havenÕt ever chucked anyone
, have you?Ó said Ron. ÒYou 
and Cho just ÑÓ 
ÒSort of fell apart, yeah,Ó said Harry 
ÒWish that would happen with 
me and Lavender,Ó said Ron 
gloomily, watching Hermione sile
ntly tapping each of his mis-
spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected 
themselves on the page. ÒBut the mo
re I hint I want to finish it, the 
tighter she holds on. ItÕs like 
going out with the giant squid.Ó 
ÒThere,Ó said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing 
back RonÕs essay. 
ÒThanks a million,Ó said Ron. ÒC
an I borrow your quill for the 
conclusion?Ó 
Harry, who had found nothing usef
ul in the Half-Blood PrinceÕs 
notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only 
ones left in the common room, Seam
us having just gone up to bed 
cursing Snape and his essay. The on
ly sounds were the crackling of 
the fire and Ron scratching out 
one last paragraph on dementors 
using HermioneÕs quill. Harry ha
d just closed the Half-Blood 
PrinceÕs book, yawning, when Ñ 
Crack. Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his 
freshly completed essay, and Harry said, ÒKreacher!Ó 
The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. 
ÒMaster said he wanted regular 
reports on what the Malfoy boy 
is doing, so Kreacher 
has come to give ÑÓ 
 &#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .79" Crack. Dobby appeared alongs
ide Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew. 
ÒDobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!Ó he squeaked, cast-
ing Kreacher a resentful look. ÒAnd Kreacher ought to tell Dobby 
when he is coming to see Harry Po
tter so they can make their re-
ports together!Ó 
ÒWhat is this?Ó asked Hermione, 
still looking shocked by these 
sudden appearances. ÒWha
tÕs going on, Harry?Ó 
Harry hesitated before answering,
 because he had not told Her-
mione about setting Kreacher an
d Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-
elves were always such a touchy subject with her. 
ÒWell . . . theyÕve be
en following Malfoy for me,Ó he said. 
ÒNight and day,Ó croaked Kreacher. 
ÒDobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!Ó said Dobby 
proudly, swaying where he stood. Hermione looked indignant. 
ÒYou havenÕt slept, Dobby? But 
surely, Harry, you didnÕt tell him 
not to ÑÓ 
ÒNo, of course I didnÕt,Ó said Harry quickly. ÒDobby, you can 
sleep, all right? But has either of
 you found out anything?Ó he has-
tened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again. 
ÒMaster Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure 
blood,Ó croaked Kreacher
 at once. ÒHis feat
ures recall the fine 
bones of my mistress and hi
s manners are those of ÑÓ 
ÒDraco Malfoy is a bad boy!Ó squeaked Dobby angrily. ÒA bad 
boy who Ñ who ÑÓ 
He shuddered from the tassel of 
his tea cozy to the toes of his 
socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it;

tirely unexpected, caught him 
around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby 
struggled, then went limp. 
ÒThank you, Harry Potter,Ó he pant
ed. ÒDobby still finds it dif-
ficult to speak ill of 
his old masters. . . .Ó 
Harry released him; Dobby straight
ened his tea cozy and said 
defiantly to Kreacher, ÒBut Kreach
er should know that Draco Mal-
foy is not a good mast
er to a house-elf!Ó 
ÒYeah, we donÕt need to hear 
about you being in love with 
Malfoy,Ó Harry told Kreacher. ÒLetÕs fast forward to where heÕs 
actually been going.Ó 
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, ÒMaster 
Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he
 sleeps in a dormitory in the dun-
geons, he attends his clas
ses in a variety of ÑÓ 
ÒDobby, you tell me,Ó said Harry,
 cutting across Kreacher. ÒHas 
he been going anywhere
 he shouldnÕt have?Ó 
ÒHarry Potter, sir,Ó squeaked Dobb
y, his great orblike eyes shin-
ing in the firelight, Òthe Malfoy
 boy is breaking no rules that 
Dobby can discover, but he is sti
ll keen to avoid detection. He has 
been making regular visits to the 
seventh floor with a variety of 
other students, who keep watch 
for him while he enters ÑÓ 
ÒThe Room of Requirement!Ó sa
id Harry, smacking himself 
hard on the forehead with 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 Hermione and 
Ron stared at him. ÒThatÕs where heÕs been sneaking off to! ThatÕs 
where heÕs doing . . . whatever heÕs
 doing! And I bet thatÕs why heÕs 
been disappearing off the map Ñ co
me to think of it, IÕve never 
seen the Room of Re
quirement on there!Ó 
ÒMaybe the Marauders never knew
 the room was there,Ó said 
Ron. &#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .7;" ÒI think itÕll be part of the ma
gic of the room,Ó said Hermione. 
ÒIf you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.Ó 
ÒDobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Mal-
foyÕs doing?Ó said Harry eagerly. 
ÒNo, Harry Potter, that is 
impossible,Ó said Dobby. 
ÒNo, itÕs not,Ó said Harry at on
ce. ÒMalfoy got into our head-
quarters there last year, so IÕll be able to get in and spy on him, no 
problem.Ó 
ÒBut I donÕt think you will, Ha
rry,Ó said Hermione slowly. ÒMal-
foy already knew exactly how we 
were using the room, didnÕt he, 
because that stupid Marietta had 
blabbed. He needed the room to 
become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you donÕt know 
what the room becomes when Malfoy
 goes in there, so you donÕt 
know what to ask it to transform into.Ó 
ÒThereÕll be a way around that,Ó 
said Harry dismissively. ÒYouÕve 
done brilliantly, Dobby.Ó 
ÒKreacherÕs done well too,Ó said 
Hermione kindly; but far from 
looking grateful, Kreacher aver
ted his huge, bloodshot eyes and 
croaked at the ceiling, ÒThe Mu
dblood is speaking to Kreacher, 
Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear ÑÓ 
ÒGet out of it,Ó Harry snapped 
at him, and Kreacher made one 
last deep bow and Disapparated. 
ÒYouÕd better go and get some 
sleep too, Dobby.Ó 
ÒThank you, Harry Potter, sir!Ó 
squeaked Dobby happily, and he 
too vanished. 
ÒHow goodÕs this?Ó said Harry en
thusiastically, turning to Ron 
and Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. ÒWe know 
where MalfoyÕs going! WeÕv
e got him cornered now!Ó 
ÒYeah, itÕs great,Ó said Ron gl
umly, who was attempting to mop

 .7." up the sodden mass of ink that ha
d recently been an almost com-
pleted essay. Hermione pulled it
 toward her and began siphoning 
the ink off with her wand. 
ÒBut whatÕs all this about him going up there with a Ôvariety of 
studentsÕ?Ó said Hermione. ÒHow 
many people are in on it? You 
wouldnÕt think heÕd trust lots of them to know what heÕs do-
ing. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, that is weird,Ó said Harry,
 frowning. ÒI heard him telling 
Crabbe it wasnÕt CrabbeÕs business 
what he was doing . . . so whatÕs 
he telling all these . 
. . all these . . .Ó 
HarryÕs voice tailed away; he
 was staring at the fire. 
ÒGod, IÕve been stupid,Ó he said quietly. ÒItÕs obvious, isnÕt it? 
There was a great vat of it down in
 the dungeon. . . . He couldÕve 
nicked some any time duri
ng that lesson. . . .Ó 
ÒNicked what?Ó said Ron. 
ÒPolyjuice Potion. He stole some
 of the Polyjuice Potion Slug-
horn showed us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There arenÕt a whole 
variety of students standing guard fo
r Malfoy . . . itÕs just Crabbe 
and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it 
all fits!Ó said Harry, jumping up 
and starting to pace in front of th
e fire. ÒTheyÕre stupid enough to 
do what theyÕre told even if he wonÕt tell them what heÕs up to . . . 
but he doesnÕt want them to be
 seen lurking around outside the 
Room of Requirement, so heÕs got them taking Polyjuice to make 
them look like other people. . . 
. Those two girls I saw him with 
when he missed Quidditch Ñ ha! Crabbe and Goyle!Ó 
ÒDo you mean to say,Ó said Hermione in a hushed voice, Òthat 
that little girl whose scales I repaired Ñ ?Ó 
ÒYeah, of course!Ó said Harry loud
ly, staring at her. ÒOf course! 
Malfoy mustÕve been inside the r
oom at the time, so she Ñ what 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .77" am I talking about? Ñ 
he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to 
come out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl 
who dropped the toadspawn too! We
Õve been walking past him all 
the time and not realizing it!Ó 
ÒHeÕs got Crabbe and Goyle tran
sforming into girls?Ó guffawed 
Ron. ÒBlimey . . . No wonder they
 donÕt look too happy these days. 
. . . IÕm surprised they donÕt 
tell him to stuff it. . . .Ó 
ÒWell, they wouldnÕt, would they
, if heÕs shown them his Dark 
Mark?Ó said Harry. 
ÒHmmm . . . the Dark Mark we don
Õt know exists,Ó said Hermi-
one skeptically, rolling up RonÕs dr
ied essay before it could come to 
any more harm and handing it to him. 
ÒWeÕll see,Ó said Harry confidently. 
ÒYes, we will,Ó Hermione said, getti
ng to her feet and stretching. 
ÒBut, Harry, before you get all excited, I still donÕt think youÕll be 
able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing whatÕs 
there first. And I donÕt think you 
should forgetÓ Ñ she heaved her 
bag onto her shoulder and gave 
him a very serious look Ñ Òthat 
what youÕre 
supposed
 to be concentrating on is getting that memory 
from Slughorn. Good night.Ó 
Harry watched her go, feeling sl
ightly disgruntled. Once the 
door to the girlsÕ dormitories had 
closed behind her he rounded on 
Ron. ÒWhat dÕyou think?Ó 
ÒWish I could Disapparate like a ho
use-elf,Ó said Ron, staring at 
the spot where Dobby had vanished. 
ÒIÕd have that Apparition Test 
in the bag.Ó 
Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like 
hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .7<" and what he, Harry, would see when 
he went in there the following 
day, for whatever Hermione said, Ha
rry was sure that if Malfoy had 
been able to see the headquarters of 
the D.A., he would be able to see 
MalfoyÕs . . . what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A store-
room? A workshop? HarryÕs mind wo
rked feverishly and his dreams, 
when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of 
Malfoy, who turned into
 Slughorn, who turned into Snape. . . . 
Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the fol-
lowing morning; he had a free 
period before Defense Against the 
Dark Arts and was determined to 
spend it trying to get into the 
Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously show-
ing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the 
room, which irritated Harry, becaus
e he thought she might be a lot 
of help if she wanted to. 
ÒLook,Ó he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand 
on the 
Daily Prophet,
 which she had just removed from a post owl, 
to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. ÒI havenÕt for-
gotten about Slughorn, but I havenÕ
t got a clue how to get that 
memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldnÕt I find 
out what MalfoyÕs doing?Ó 
ÒIÕve already told 
you, you need to 
persuade Slughorn,Ó said Her-
mione. ÒItÕs not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or 
Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing 
around outside the Room of RequirementÓ Ñ she jerked the 
Prophet out from under HarryÕs hand and unfolded it to look at the 
front page Ñ Òyou should go and 
find Slughorn and start appeal-
ing to his better nature.Ó 
ÒAnyone we know Ñ ?Ó asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the 
headlines. 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .7/" ÒYes!Ó said Hermione, causing 
both Harry and Ron to gag on 
their breakfast. ÒBut itÕs all right,
 heÕs not dead Ñ itÕs Mundungus, 
heÕs been arrested and sent to
 Azkaban! Something to do with 
impersonating an Inferius during 
an attempted burglary . . . and 
someone called Octavius Pepper ha
s vanished. . . . Oh, and how 
horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been 
arrested for trying to kill his 
grandparents, they think he was un
der the Imperius Curse. . . .Ó 
They finished their breakfast in
 silence. Hermione set off imme-
diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he 
still had to finish his conclusion
 on SnapeÕs dementor essay; and 
Harry for the corridor on 
the seventh floor and 
the stretch of wall 
opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do 
ballet. Harry slipped on his Invisibility
 Cloak once he had found an 
empty passage, but he need not 
have bothered. When he reached 
his destination he found it dese
rted. Harry was not sure whether 
his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy in-
side it or out, but at least his fi
rst attempt was not 
going to be com-
plicated by the presence of Crabbe
 or Goyle pretending to be an 
eleven-year-old girl. 
He closed his eyes as he appr
oached the place where the Room 
of RequirementÕs door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; 
he had become most accomplished 
at it last year. Concentrating 
with all his might he thought, 
I need to see what MalfoyÕs doing in 
here. . . . 
I need to see what MalfoyÕs doing in here.
 . . . 
I need to see 
what MalfoyÕs doing in here. 
. . . Three times he walked past th
e door; then, his heart pounding 
with excitement, he opened
 his eyes and faced it Ñ 
But he was still looking at a st
retch of mundanely blank wall. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .75" He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone 
remained solid and unyielding. 
ÒOkay,Ó said Harry aloud. ÒO
kay . . . I thought the wrong 
thing. . . .Ó 
He pondered for a moment then 
set off again, eyes closed, con-
centrating as hard as he could. 
I need to see the place where 
Malfoy keeps coming secretly.
 . . . 
I need to see the place where Ma
lfoy keeps coming secretly.
 . . . After three walks past, he op
ened his eyes expectantly. 
There was no door. 
ÒOh, come off it,Ó he told the wa
ll irritably. ÒThat was a clear in-
struction. . . . Fine . . .Ó 
He thought hard for several minu
tes before striding off once 
more. 
I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy.
 . . . 
He did not immediately open his 
eyes when he had finished his 
patrolling; he was list
ening hard, as though he might hear the door 
pop into existence. He heard noth
ing, however, except the distant 
twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes. 
There was still no door. 
Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a 
gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-
der the impression that they had 
just encountered a particularly 
foulmouthed ghost. 
Harry tried every variation of ÒI need to see what Draco Malfoy 
is doing inside youÓ that he coul
d think of for a whole hour, at the 
end of which he was forced to co
ncede that Hermione might have 
had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-
trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .76" pulling off his Invisibility Cloak an
d stuffing it into his bag as he 
went. ÒLate again, Potter,Ó said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the 
candlelit classroom. ÒTen 
points from Gryffindor.Ó 
Harry scowled at Snape as he flun
g himself into the seat beside 
Ron; half the class was still on 
its feet, taking ou
t books and orga-
nizing their thin
gs; he could not be much later than any of them. 
ÒBefore we start, I want your dementor essays,Ó said Snape, wav-
ing his wand carelessly, so that 
twenty-five scrolls of parchment 
soared into the air and landed in
 a neat pile on his desk. ÒAnd I 
hope for your sakes they are better
 than the tripe 
I had to endure 
on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your 
books to page Ñ what 
is it, Mr. Finnigan?Ó 
ÒSir,Ó said Seamus, ÒIÕve been wondering, how do you tell the 
difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was 
something in the paper 
about an Inferius ÑÓ 
ÒNo, there wasnÕt,Ó said 
Snape in a bored voice. 
ÒBut sir, I heard 
people talking ÑÓ 
ÒIf you had actually read the ar
ticle in question, Mr. Finnigan, 
you would have known th
at the so-called Infe
rius was nothing but 
a smelly sneak thief by the na
me of Mundungus Fletcher.Ó 
ÒI thought Snape and Mundungus 
were on the same side,Ó mut-
tered Harry to Ron and Hermione
. ÒShouldnÕt he be upset Mun-
dungus has been
 arrest ÑÓ 
ÒBut Potter seems to 
have a lot to say on the subject,Ó said 
Snape, pointing suddenly at the ba
ck of the room, his black eyes 
fixed on Harry ÒLet us ask Potter
 how we would tell the difference 
between an Inferi
us and a ghost.Ó 
The whole class looked around 
at Harry, who hastily tried to 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .<8" recall what Dumbledore had told him
 the night that they had gone 
to visit Slughorn. 
ÒEr Ñ well Ñ ghosts are transparent ÑÓ he said. 
ÒOh, very good,Ó interrupted Snape,
 his lip curling. ÒYes, it is 
easy to see that nearly six years 
of magical education have not been 
wasted on you, Potter. Ô
Ghosts are transparent.
ÕÓ 
Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pi
tched giggle. Several other peo-
ple were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, 
though his insides were boiling, 
ÒYeah, ghosts are transparent, but 
Inferi are dead bodies, arenÕt 
they? So theyÕd be solid ÑÓ 
ÒA five-year-old could have told
 us as much,Ó sneered Snape. 
ÒThe Inferius is a corpse that 
has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-
ardÕs spells. It is not alive, it is
 merely used like a puppet to do the 
wizardÕs bidding. A ghost, as I trus
t that you are al
l aware by now, 
is the imprint of a departed soul 
left upon the earth . . . and of 
course, as Potter so wisely tells us, 
transparent.
Ó ÒWell, what Harry said is the most useful if weÕre trying to 
tell them apart!Ó said Ron. ÒWhe
n we come face-to-face with one 
down a dark alley, weÕre going to be
 having a shufti to see if itÕs 
solid, arenÕt we, weÕre not going to be asking, ÔExcuse me, are you 
the imprint of a departed soul?ÕÓ 
There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look 
Snape gave the class. 
ÒAnother ten points from Gryffin
dor,Ó said Snape. ÒI would ex-
pect nothing more sophisticated 
from you, Ronald Weasley, the 
boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.Ó 
ÒNo!Ó whispered Hermione, grabbing HarryÕs arm as he opened 
his mouth furiously. ÒThereÕs no po
int, youÕll just end up in deten-
tion again, leave it!Ó 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .<9" ÒNow open your books to page 
two hundred and thirteen,Ó said 
Snape, smirking a little, Òand read the first two paragraphs on the 
Cruciatus Curse. . . .Ó 
Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell 
sounded at the end of the lesson,
 Lavender caught up with Ron 
and Harry (Hermione mysteriously 
melted out of sight as she ap-
proached) and abused Snape hotly 
for his jibe about RonÕs Appari-
tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by 
making a detour into the bo
ysÕ bathroom with Harry. 
ÒSnapeÕs right, though, isnÕt he?Ó said Ron, after staring into a 
cracked mirror for a minute or tw
o. ÒI dunno whether itÕs worth 
me taking the test. I 
just canÕt get the hang of Apparition.Ó 
ÒYou might as well do the extra 
practice sessions in Hogsmeade 
and see where they get you,Ó said
 Harry reasonably. ÒItÕll be more 
interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if 
youÕre still not Ñ you know Ñ as 
good as youÕd like to be, you can 
postpone the test, do it with me ov
er the summ Ñ Myrtle, this is 
the boysÕ bathroom!Ó 
The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind 
them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through 
thick, white, round glasses. 
ÒOh,Ó she said glumly. ÒItÕs you two.Ó 
ÒWho were you expecting?Ó said Ron, looking at her in the 
mirror. 
ÒNobody,Ó said Myrtle, picking m
oodily at a spot on her chin. 
ÒHe said heÕd come back and see me, but then 
you said youÕd pop 
in and visit me tooÓ Ñ she gave
 Harry a reproach
ful look Ñ Òand 
I havenÕt seen you for months and 
months. IÕve learned not to ex-
pect too much from boys.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .<:" ÒI thought you lived in that girl
sÕ bathroom?Ó sa
id Harry, who 
had been careful to give
 the place a wide bert
h for some years now. 
ÒI do,Ó she said, with a sulky little
 shrug, Òbut that doesnÕt mean 
I canÕt 
visit other places. I came and sa
w you in your bath once, 
remember?Ó ÒVividly,Ó said Harry. 
ÒBut I thought he liked me,Ó she said plaintively. ÒMaybe if you 
two left, heÕd come back again. . 
. . We had lots in common. . . . 
IÕm sure he felt it. . . .Ó 
And she looked hopefu
lly toward the door. 
ÒWhen you say you had lots in 
common,Ó said Ron, sounding 
rather amused now, ÒdÕyou mean he lives in an S-bend too?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Myrtle defiantly, her 
voice echoing loudly around the 
old tiled bathroom. ÒI mean heÕs 
sensitive, people bully him too, 
and he feels lonely and hasnÕt got anybody to talk to, and heÕs not 
afraid to show his feelings and cry!Ó 
ÒThereÕs been a boy in here cryi
ng?Ó said Harry curiously. ÒA 
young boy?Ó 
ÒNever you mind!Ó said Myrtle, 
her small, leaky eyes fixed on 
Ron, who was now definitely grinni
ng. ÒI promised I wouldnÕt tell 
anyone, and IÕll take 
his secret to the ÑÓ 
ÒÑ not the grave, surely?Ó said 
Ron with a snort. ÒThe sewers, 
maybe . . .Ó 
Myrtle gave a howl of rage and 
dived back into 
the toilet, caus-
ing water to slop over the sides 
and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle 
seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. 
ÒYouÕre right,Ó he said, swinging
 his schoolbag back over his 
shoulder, ÒIÕll do the practice sess
ions in Hogsmeade before I de-
cide about taking the test.Ó 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .<;" And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the 
rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the 
test in a fortnight. Harry felt rath
er jealous watchin
g them all get 
ready to go into the vi
llage; he missed making trips there, and it 
was a particularly fine spring day,
 one of the first clear skies they 
had seen in a long time. However,
 he had decided to use the time 
to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement. 
ÒYouÕd do better,Ó said Hermione, 
when he confided this plan to 
Ron and her in the entrance hall, Òt
o go straight to SlughornÕs of-
fice and try and get that memory from him.Ó 
ÒIÕve been trying!Ó said Harry cro
ssly, which was perfectly true. 
He had lagged behind after every Po
tions lesson that week in an at-
tempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the 
dungeon so fast that Harry had no
t been able to ca
tch him. Twice, 
Harry had gone to his office and kn
ocked, but received no reply, 
though on the second occasion 
he was sure he
 had heard the 
quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone. 
ÒHe doesnÕt want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell IÕve been 
trying to get him on his own again,
 and heÕs not going to let it hap-
pen!Ó ÒWell, youÕve just got to keep at it, havenÕt you?Ó 
The short queue of people waiting 
to file past Filch, who was do-
ing his usual prodding 
act with the Secrecy 
Sensor, moved forward 
a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the 
caretaker. He wished Ron and He
rmione both luck, then turned 
and climbed the marble staircase 
again, determined, whatever Her-
mione said, to devote an hour or 
two to the Room of Requirement. 
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Ma-
rauderÕs Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .<." concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, Ò
I solemnly 
swear that I am up to no good,
Ó and scanned it carefully. 
As it was Sunday morning, near
ly all the students were inside 
their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the 
Ravenclaws in another, the Slyt
herins in the dungeons, and the 
Hufflepuffs in the basement near
 the kitchens. Here and there a 
stray person meandered around th
e library or up a corridor. . . . 
There were a few people out in the 
grounds . . . and there, alone in 
the seventh-floor corridor, was Gr
egory Goyle. There was no sign 
of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about 
that; if Goyle was standing guar
d outside it, the room was open, 
whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up 
the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the 
corridor, when he began to creep, ve
ry slowly, toward the very same 
little girl, clutching her heavy br
ass scales, that Hermione had so 
kindly helped a fortnight before. 
He waited until he was right be-
hind her before bending very lo
w and whispering, ÒHello . . . 
youÕre very pretty, arenÕt you?Ó 
Goyle gave a high-pitched scream 
of terror, threw the scales up 
into the air, and sprinted away, va
nishing from sight long before the 
sound of the scales smashing had 
stopped echoing around the corri-
dor. Laughing, Harry turned to co
ntemplate the blank wall behind 
which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware 
that someone unwelcome was out ther
e, but not daring to make an 
appearance. It gave Harry a most ag
reeable feeling of power as he 
tried to remember what form of
 words he had not yet tried. 
Yet this hopeful mood did not last
 long. Half an hour later, hav-
ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy 
was up to, the wall was just as door
less as ever. Harry felt frustrated 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .<7" beyond belief; Malfoy might be ju
st feet away from him, and there 
was still not the tiniest shred of ev
idence as to what he was doing in 
there. Losing his patience comple
tely, Harry ran at the wall and 
kicked it. 
ÒOUCH!Ó He thought he might have broken his
 toe; as he clutched it and 
hopped on one foot, the Invisi
bility Cloak slipped off him. 
ÒHarry?Ó He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his ut-
ter astonishment, was Tonks, walk
ing toward him as though she 
frequently strolled 
up this corridor. 
ÒWhatÕre you doing here?Ó he said
, scrambling to his feet again; 
why did she always 
have to find him lying on the floor? 
ÒI came to see Dumbledore,Ó said Tonks. 
Harry thought she looked terribl
e: thinner than usual, her 
mouse-colored hair lank. 
ÒHis office isnÕt here,Ó said Ha
rry, ÒitÕs round the other side of 
the castle, behind the gargoyle ÑÓ 
ÒI know,Ó said Tonks. ÒHeÕs not 
there. Apparently heÕs gone away 
again.Ó ÒHas he?Ó said Harry, putting his 
bruised foot gingerly back on 
the floor. ÒHey Ñ you 
donÕt know where he
 goes, I suppose?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Tonks. 
ÒWhat did you want to see him about?Ó 
ÒNothing in particular,Ó said To
nks, picking, apparently uncon-
sciously, at the sleeve of her robe. ÒI just thought he might know 
whatÕs going on. . . . IÕve heard rumors . . . people getting hurt . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, I know, itÕs al
l been in the papers,Ó
 said Harry. ÒThat lit-
tle kid trying to kill his ÑÓ

 .<<" ÒThe ProphetÕs
 often behind the times,Ó 
said Tonks, who didnÕt 
seem to be listening to him. ÒYou
 havenÕt had any letters from any-
one in the Order recently?Ó 
ÒNo one from the Order writes 
to me anymore,Ó said Harry, 
Ònot since Sirius ÑÓ 
He saw that her eyes 
had filled with tears. 
ÒIÕm sorry,Ó he muttered awkwardly. ÒI mean . . . I miss him, as 
well. . . .Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó said Tonks blankly, as
 though she had not heard him. 
ÒWell . . . IÕll
 see you around, Harry . . .Ó 
And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, 
leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the 
Invisibility Cloak on again and re
sumed his efforts to get into the 
Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow 
feeling in his stomach and the kn
owledge that Ron and Hermione 
would soon be back for lunch ma
de him abandon the attempt and 
leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to 
leave for some hours to come. 
He found Ron and Hermione in th
e Great Hall, already halfway 
through an early lunch. 
ÒI did it Ñ well, kind of!Ó Ron 
told Harry enthusiastically when 
he caught sight of him. ÒI was supposed to be Apparating to out-
side Madam PuddifootÕs Tea Shop an
d I overshot it a bit, ended up 
near ScrivenshaftÕs, but at least I moved!Ó 
ÒGood one,Ó said Harry. ÒH
owÕd you do, Hermione?Ó 
ÒOh, she was perfect, obviousl
y,Ó said Ron, before Hermione 
could answer. ÒPerfect deliberation
, divination, and desperation or 
whatever the hell it is Ñ we all w
ent for a quick drink in the Three 
Broomsticks after and you shouldÕve heard Twycross going on 
&#'""0*1*-)$23'""(--4" .</" about her Ñ IÕll be 
surprised if he doesnÕt pop the question 
soon ÑÓ 
ÒAnd what about you?Ó asked He
rmione, ignoring Ron. ÒHave 
you been up at the Room of 
Requirement all this time?Ó 
ÒYep,Ó said Harry. ÒAnd guess wh
o I ran into up there? Tonks!Ó 
ÒTonks?Ó repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking 
surprised. 
ÒYeah, she said sheÕd come to visit Dumbledore. . . .Ó 
ÒIf you ask me,Ó said Ron once 
Harry had finished describing his 
conversation with Tonks, ÒsheÕs cr
acking up a bit. Losing her nerve 
after what happened 
at the Ministry.Ó 
ÒItÕs a bit odd,Ó said Hermione, 
who for some reason looked very 
concerned. ÒSheÕs supposed to be guarding the school, whyÕs she 
suddenly abandoning her post to 
come and see Dumbledore when 
heÕs not even here?Ó 
ÒI had a thought,Ó said Harry tent
atively. He felt strange about 
voicing it; this was much more He
rmioneÕs territory than his. ÒYou 
donÕt think she can have 
been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?Ó 
Hermione stared at him. 
ÒWhat on earth makes you say that?Ó 
ÒI dunno,Ó said Harry, shruggin
g, Òbut she was nearly crying 
when I mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-
legged thing now. . . . I wondered
 whether it hadnÕt become . . . 
you know . . . him.Ó 
ÒItÕs a thought,Ó said Hermione 
slowly. ÒBut I still donÕt know 
why sheÕd be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if thatÕs re-
ally why she wa
s here. . . .Ó 
ÒGoes back to what I said, doesn
Õt it?Ó said Ron, who was now 
shoveling mashed potato into his
 mouth. ÒSheÕs gone a bit funny. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-*'"
 .<5" Lost her nerve. Women,Ó he said 
wisely to Harry, ÒtheyÕre easily 
upset.Ó 
ÒAnd yet,Ó said Hermione, coming
 out of her reverie, ÒI doubt 
youÕd find a 
woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam 
Rosmerta didnÕt laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and 
the Mimbulus mimbletonia.
Ó Ron scowled.

   atches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the 
castle turrets, but these signs 
of approaching summer did not 
lift HarryÕs mood. He had been thwa
rted, both in his attempts to 
find out what Malfoy was doing, and 
in his efforts to start a conver-
sation with Slughorn that might 
lead, somehow, to Slughorn hand-
ing over the memory he had appa
rently suppressed for decades. 
ÒFor the last time, just forget about Malfoy,Ó Hermione told 
Harry firmly. 
They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard 
after lunch. Hermione and Ron were
 both clutching a Ministry of 
Magic leaflet Ñ 
Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid 
Them Ñ for they were taking their 
tests that very afternoon, but by 
and large the leaflets
 had not proved soothing to the nerves. 
Ron gave a start and tried to 
hide behind Hermione as a girl 
came around the corner. 
ÒIt isnÕt Lavender,Ó said Hermione wearily. 
%"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .67" ÒOh, good,Ó said Ron, relaxing. 
ÒHarry Potter?Ó said the girl. ÒI
 was asked to give you this.Ó 
ÒThanks . . .Ó 
HarryÕs heart sank as 
he took the small scroll of parchment. 
Once the girl was out of earsho
t he said, ÒDumbledore said we 
wouldnÕt be having any more le
ssons until I got the memory!Ó 
ÒMaybe he wants to check on 
how youÕre doing?Ó suggested 
Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than find-
ing DumbledoreÕs long, narrow, slan
ted writing he saw an untidy 
sprawl, very difficult to read due 
to the presence of large blotches 
on the parchment wher
e the ink had run.

ÒOh, for heavenÕs sake,Ó she said, 
scanning it quickly and passing 
it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous. 
ÒHeÕs mental

 .68" Harry and me! Told them to help 
themselves! And now Hagrid ex-
pects us to go down there and cry 
over its horrible hairy body!Ó 
ÒItÕs not just that,Ó said Hermio
ne. ÒHeÕs asking us to leave the 
castle at night and he knows securityÕs a million times tighter and 
how much trouble weÕd be in if we were caught.Ó 
ÒWeÕve been down to see him by
 night before,Ó said Harry. 
ÒYes, but for something like this?Ó
 said Hermione. ÒWeÕve risked 
a lot to help Hagrid out, but after 
all Ñ AragogÕs dead. If it were a 
question of saving him ÑÓ 
ÒÑ IÕd want to go even less,Ó sa
id Ron firmly. ÒYou didnÕt meet 
him, Hermione. Believe me, being de
ad will have improved him a 
lot.Ó 
Harry took the note back and 
stared down at all the inky 
blotches all over it. Tears had clea
rly fallen thick and fast upon the 
parchment. . . . 
ÒHarry, you 
canÕt
 be thinking of going,
Ó said Hermione. ÒItÕs 
such a pointless thing 
to get detention for.Ó 
Harry sighed. ÒYeah, I know,Ó he sa
id. ÒI sÕpose HagridÕll have to 
bury Aragog without us.Ó 
ÒYes, he will,Ó said Hermione, 
looking relieved. ÒLook, Potions 
will be almost empty th
is afternoon, with us 
all off doing our tests. 
. . . Try and soften Slug
horn up a bit then!Ó 
ÒFifty-seventh time lucky, you think?Ó said Harry bitterly. 
ÒLucky,Ó said Ron suddenly. ÒH
arry, thatÕs it Ñ get lucky!Ó 
ÒWhat dÕyou mean?Ó 
ÒUse your lu
cky potion!Ó 
ÒRon, thatÕs Ñ thatÕs it!Ó said
 Hermione, sounding stunned. ÒOf 
course! Why didnÕt I think of it?Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .69" Harry stared at them bo
th. ÒFelix Felicis?Ó he
 said. ÒI dunno . . . 
I was sort of saving it. . . .Ó 
ÒWhat for?Ó demanded Ron incredulously. 
ÒWhat on earth is more import
ant than this memory, Harry?Ó 
asked Hermione. 
Harry did not answer. The thought of
 that little golden bottle 
had hovered on the edge
s of his imagination for some time; vague 
and unformulated plans that invo
lved Ginny splitting up with 
Dean, and Ron somehow being ha
ppy to see her with a new 
boyfriend, had been fermenting in
 the depths of his brain, unac-
knowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between 
sleeping and waking. . . . 
ÒHarry? Are you still with us?Ó asked Hermione. 
ÒWha Ñ ? Yeah, of course,Ó he said, pulling himself together. 
ÒWell . . . okay. If I canÕt get Sl
ughorn to talk this afternoon, IÕll 
take some Felix and have 
another go this evening.Ó 
ÒThatÕs decided, then,Ó said Herm
ione briskly, getting to her feet 
and performing a graceful pirouette. ÒDestination . . . determina-
tion . . . deliberation
 . . .Ó she murmured. 
ÒOh, stop that,Ó Ron begged her, 
ÒI feel sick enough as it is Ñ 
quick, hide me!Ó 
ÒIt isnÕt Lavender!Ó said Hermio
ne impatiently, as another cou-
ple of girls appeared in the cour
tyard and Ron dived behind her. 
ÒCool,Ó said Ron, peering over 
HermioneÕs shoulder to check. 
ÒBlimey, they donÕt look happy, do they?Ó 
ÒTheyÕre the Montgomery sisters an
d of course they donÕt look 
happy, didnÕt you hear what happened to their little brother?Ó said 
Hermione. 
 $1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .6:" ÒIÕm losing track of whatÕs happe
ning to everyoneÕs relatives, to 
be honest,Ó said Ron. 
ÒWell, their brother was attacked
 by a werewolf. The rumor is 
that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy 
was only five and he di
ed in St. MungoÕs, they
 couldnÕt save him.Ó 
ÒHe died?Ó repeated Harry, shocked. ÒBut surely werewolves 
donÕt kill, they just turn you into one of them?Ó 
ÒThey sometimes kill,Ó said Ro
n, who looked unusually grave 
now. ÒIÕve heard of it happening
 when the werewolf gets carried 
away.Ó 
ÒWhat was the werewolfÕs na
me?Ó said Harry quickly. 
ÒWell, the rumor is that it wa
s that Fenrir Greyback,Ó said 
Hermione. 
ÒI knew it Ñ the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one 
Lupin told me about!Ó said Harry angrily. 
Hermione looked at him bleakly. 
ÒHarry, youÕve got to get that 
memory,Ó she said. ÒItÕs all about 
stopping Voldemort, isnÕt it? Thes
e dreadful things that are hap-
pening are all down 
to him. . . .Ó 
The bell rang overhead in the 
castle and both Hermione and 
Ron jumped to their fee
t, looking terrified. 
ÒYouÕll do fine,Ó Harry told them 
both, as they headed toward 
the entrance hall to meet the rest
 of the people taking their Ap-
parition Test. ÒGood luck.Ó 
ÒAnd you too!Ó said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry 
headed off to the dungeons. 
There were only three of them 
in Potions that afternoon: Harry, 
Ernie, and Draco Malfoy. 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .6." ÒAll too young to Apparate just
 yet?Ó said Slughorn genially. 
ÒNot turned seventeen yet?Ó 
They shook their heads. 
ÒAh well,Ó said Slughorn cheerily, Òas weÕre so few, weÕll do some-
thing fun. I want you all to brew 
me up something amusing!Ó 
ÒThat sounds good, sir,Ó said Er
nie sycophantically, rubbing his 
hands together. Malfoy, 
on the other hand, di
d not crack a smile. 
ÒWhat do you mean, Ôsomething amusingÕ?Ó he said irritably. 
ÒOh, surprise me,Ó said Slughorn airily. 
Malfoy opened his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 with a sulky 
expression. It could not have been 
plainer that he thought this les-
son was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching 
him over the top of his own book, 
Malfoy was begrudging the time 
he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement. 
Was it his imagination, or did Ma
lfoy, like Tonks, look thinner? 
Certainly he looked paler; his sk
in still had that grayish tinge, 
probably because he so rarely saw 
daylight these days. But there was 
no air of smugness, excitement, or
 superiority; none of the swagger 
that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted 
openly of the mission he had been 
given by Voldemort. . . . There 
could be only one conclusion, in
 HarryÕs opinion: The mission, 
whatever it was, was going badly. 
Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood 
PrinceÕs version of ÒAn Elixir to Induce Euphoria,Ó which seemed 
not only to meet SlughornÕs inst
ructions, but whic
h might (HarryÕs 
heart leapt as the thought struck
 him) put Slughorn into such a 
good mood that he woul
d be prepared to hand
 over that memory 
if Harry could persuade 
him to taste some. . . . 
$1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .6;" ÒWell, now, this looks absolutely
 wonderful,Ó said Slughorn an 
hour and a half later, clapping hi
s hands together as he stared down 
into the sunshine yellow contents of HarryÕs cauldron. Ò
Euphoria,
 I 
take it? And whatÕs that
 I smell? Mmmm . . . youÕ
ve added just a sprig 
of peppermint, havenÕt you? Unorth
odox, but what a stroke of inspi-
ration, Harry, of course, that woul
d tend to counterbalance the occa-
sional side effects of excessive sin
ging and nose-tweaking. . . . I really 
donÕt know where you get these brai
n waves, my boy . . . unless ÑÓ 
Harry pushed the Half-Blood PrinceÕs book deeper into his bag 
with his foot. 
ÒÑ itÕs just your motherÕs
 genes coming out in you!Ó 
ÒOh . . . yeah, maybe,Ó 
said Harry, relieved. 
Ernie was looking rather grumpy
; determined to outshine Harry 
for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had 
curdled and formed a kind of purple
 dumpling at the bottom of his 
cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn 
had pronounced his Hiccuping 
Solution merely Òpassable.Ó 
The bell rang and both Erni
e and Malfoy left at once. 
ÒSir,Ó Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his 
shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself 
and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could. 
ÒProfessor Ñ Professor, donÕt you want to taste my po Ñ ?Ó 
called Harry desperately. 
But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the caul-
dron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly 
back upstairs to the common room. 
Ron and Hermione returned
 in the late afternoon. 
ÒHarry!Ó cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait 
hole. ÒHarry, I passed!Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .6/" ÒWell done!Ó he said. ÒAnd Ron?Ó 
ÒHe Ñ he 
just failed,Ó whispered Hermione, as Ron came 
slouching into the room looking 
most morose. ÒIt was really un-
lucky, a tiny thing, the examiner ju
st spotted that heÕd left half an 
eyebrow behind. . . . How di
d it go with Slughorn?Ó 
ÒNo joy,Ó said Harry, as Ron join
ed them. ÒBad luck, mate, but 
youÕll pass next time Ñ we can take it together.Ó 
ÒYeah, I sÕpose,Ó said Ron grumpily. ÒBut 
half an eyebrow
! Like 
that matters!Ó 
ÒI know,Ó said Hermione soothingly, Òit does seem really 
harsh. . . .Ó 
They spent most of their dinner 
roundly abusing the Apparition 
examiner, and Ron looked fraction
ally more cheerful by the time 
they set off back to the common 
room, now discussing the contin-
uing problem of Slughorn and the memory. 
ÒSo, Harry Ñ you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?Ó Ron 
demanded. ÒYeah, I sÕpose IÕd better,Ó said Ha
rry. ÒI donÕt reckon IÕll need all 
of it, not twelve hoursÕ worth, it canÕt take all night. . . . IÕll just 
take a mouthful. Two or th
ree hours should do it.Ó 
ÒItÕs a great feeling when you take
 it,Ó said Ron reminiscently. 
ÒLike you canÕt do anything wrong.Ó 
ÒWhat are you talking about?Ó sa
id Hermione, laughing. ÒYouÕve 
never taken any!Ó 
ÒYeah, but I 
thought
 I had, didnÕt I?Ó said Ron, as though ex-
plaining the obvious. ÒSame 
difference really . . .Ó 
As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and 
knew that he liked to take time ov
er meals, they lingered for a while 
in the common room, the plan 
being that Harry should go to 
$1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .66" SlughornÕs office once the teacher 
had had time to get back there. 
When the sun had sunk to the leve
l of the treetops in the Forbid-
den Forest, they deci
ded the moment had come, and after check-
ing carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the 
common room, sneake
d up to the boysÕ dormitory. 
Harry took out the rolled-up sock
s at the bottom of his trunk 
and extracted the tiny
, gleaming bottle. 
ÒWell, here goes,Ó said Harry, and 
he raised the little bottle and 
took a carefully measured gulp. 
ÒWhat does it feel like
?Ó whispered Hermione. 
Harry did not answer for a moment
. Then, slowly but surely, an 
exhilarating sense of infinite oppo
rtunity stole through him; he felt 
as though he could have done anyt
hing, anything at all . . . and 
getting the memory from Slughorn
 seemed suddenly not only pos-
sible, but positively easy. . . . 
He got to his feet, smiling,
 brimming with confidence. 
ÒExcellent,Ó he said
. ÒReally excellent. Right . . . IÕm going 
down to HagridÕs.Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó said Ron and Hermione
 together, looking aghast. 
ÒNo, Harry Ñ youÕve got to go
 and see Slughorn, remember?Ó 
said Hermione. 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry confidently. ÒIÕm
 going to HagridÕs, IÕve got a 
good feeling about go
ing to HagridÕs.Ó 
ÒYouÕve got a good feeling about 
burying a giant spider?Ó asked 
Ron, looking stunned. 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry, pulling his Invi
sibility Cloak ou
t of his bag. 
ÒI feel like itÕs the place to be
 tonight, you know what I mean?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Ron and Hermione toge
ther, both looking positively 
alarmed now. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .6<" ÒThis 
is Felix Felicis, I suppose?Ó sa
id Hermione anxiously, hold-
ing up the bottle to th
e light. ÒYou havenÕt go
t another little bottle 
full ofÑ I don
Õt know ÑÓ 
ÒEssence of Insanity?Ó suggested 
Ron, as Harry swung his cloak 
over his shoulders. 
Harry laughed, and Ron and He
rmione looked even more 
alarmed. ÒTrust me,Ó he said. ÒI know what
 IÕm doing . . . 
or at leastÓ Ñ 
he strolled confidently to
 the door Ñ ÒFelix does.Ó 
He pulled the Invisibility Cloa
k over his head and set off down 
the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurryi
ng along behind
 him. At the 
foot of the stairs, Harry 
slid through the open door. 
ÒWhat were you doing up there with 
her?Ó shrieked Lavender 
Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerg-
ing together from the boysÕ dormitories. Harry heard Ron splutter-
ing behind him as he darted acro
ss the room aw
ay from them. 
Getting through the portrait hole
 was simple; as he approached 
it, Ginny and Dean came through it
, and Harry was able to slip be-
tween them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny. 
ÒDonÕt
 push me, please, Dean,Ó sh
e said, sounding annoyed. 
ÒYouÕre always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my 
own. . . .Ó 
The portrait swung closed behind
 Harry, but not before he had 
heard Dean make an an
gry retort. . . . His feeling of elation in-
creasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to 
creep along, for he met nobody on 
his way, but this did not surprise 
him in the slightest: This evening
, he was the luckiest person at 
Hogwarts. 
Why he knew that going to HagridÕs was the right thing to do, 
$1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .60" he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few 
steps of the path at a time: He could not see the final destination, 
he could not see where Slughorn ca
me in, but he knew that he was 
going the right way to get that 
memory. When he reached the en-
trance hall he saw that Filch had 
forgotten to lock the front door. 
Beaming, Harry threw it open and 
breathed in the smell of clean 
air and grass for a moment before 
walking down the steps into the 
dusk. It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him 
how very pleasant it would be to
 pass the vegetable patch on his 
walk to HagridÕs. It was not strictly
 on the way, but it seemed clear 
to Harry that this was a whim on 
which he should act, so he di-
rected his feet immediately toward
 the vegetable patch, where he 
was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor 
Slughorn in conversation with 
Professor Sprout. Harry lurked be-
hind a low stone wall, feeling at pe
ace with the world and listening 
to their conversation. 
ÒI do thank you for ta
king the time, Pomona,Ó Slughorn was 
saying courteously, Òmost authorities agree that they are at their 
most efficacious if pi
cked at twilight.Ó 
ÒOh, I quite agree,Ó said Profe
ssor Sprout warmly. ÒThat enough 
for you?Ó 
ÒPlenty, plenty,Ó said Slughorn, 
who, Harry saw, was carrying an 
armful of leafy plants. ÒThis should
 allow for a few leaves for each 
of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. 
. . . Well, good evening to yo
u, and many th
anks again!Ó 
Professor Sprout headed off into
 the gathering darkness in the 
direction of her greenhouses, and Sl
ughorn directed his steps to the 
spot where Harry stood, invisible. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .<7" Seized with an immediate desire 
to reveal himself, Harry pulled 
off the cloak with a flourish. 
ÒGood evening, Professor.Ó 
ÒMerlinÕs beard, Harry, you made
 me jump,Ó said Slughorn, 
stopping dead in his tracks an
d looking wary. ÒHow did you get 
out of the castle?Ó 
ÒI think Filch mustÕve forgotten 
to lock the doors,Ó said Harry 
cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl. 
ÒIÕll be reporting that man, he
Õs more concerned about litter 
than proper security if you ask 
me. . . . But why are you out here, 
Harry?Ó 
ÒWell, sir, itÕs Hagrid,Ó said Harry, who knew that the right 
thing to do just now was to tell th
e truth. ÒHeÕs pretty upset. . . . 
But you wonÕt tell anyone, Professor? I donÕt want trouble for 
him. . . .Ó SlughornÕs curiosity was evidently 
aroused. ÒWell, I canÕt promise 
that,Ó he said gruffly. ÒBut I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid 
to the hilt, so IÕm sure he canÕt be up to anything very dreadful. . . .Ó 
ÒWell, itÕs this giant spider, heÕs 
had it for years. . . . It lived in 
the forest. . . . It could 
talk and everything ÑÓ 
ÒI heard rumors there were acro
mantulas in the forest,Ó said 
Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. ÒItÕs true, 
then?Ó ÒYes,Ó said Harry. ÒBut this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid 
ever got, it died last night. 
HeÕs devastated. He wants company 
while he buries it 
and I said IÕd go.Ó 
ÒTouching, touching,Ó said Slug
horn absentmindedly, his large 
droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of HagridÕs cabin. ÒBut  
 $1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .<8" acromantula venom is very valuable . 
. . If the beast only just died 
it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldnÕt want to 
do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any 
way to procure some . . . I mean
, itÕs almost impossible to get 
venom from an acromantula 
while itÕs alive. . . .Ó 
Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. 
Ò. . . seems an awful waste not to
 collect it . . . might get a hun-
dred Galleons a pint. . . 
. To be frank, my sala
ry is not large. . . .Ó 
And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. 
ÒWell,Ó he said, with a most conv
incing hesitancy, Òwell, if you 
wanted to come, Professor, Hagr
id would probably be really 
pleased. . . . Give Aragog a be
tter send-off, you know . . .Ó 
ÒYes, of course,Ó said Slughorn, 
his eyes now gleaming with en-
thusiasm. ÒI tell you what, Harry,
 IÕll meet you down there with a 
bottle or two. . . . 
WeÕll drink the poor beastÕs Ñ well Ñ not 
health Ñ but weÕll send it off in 
style, anyway, once itÕs buried. 
And IÕll change my tie,
 this one is a little 
exuberant for the occa-
sion. . . .Ó 
He bustled back into the castle, 
and Harry sped off to HagridÕs, 
delighted wi
th himself. 
ÒYeh came,Ó croaked 
Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw 
Harry emerging from the Invisi
bility Cloak in
 front of him. 
ÒYeah Ñ Ron and Hermione coul
dnÕt, though,Ó said Harry. 
ÒTheyÕre really sorry.Ó 
ÒDonÕ Ñ donÕ matter . . . HeÕdÕv
e bin touched yehÕre here, 
though, Harry. . . .Ó 
Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband 
out of what looked like a rag dipp
ed in boot polish, and his eyes  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .<9" were puffy, red, and swollen. Ha
rry patted him consolingly on the 
elbow, which was the highest point of
 Hagrid he could easily reach. 
ÒWhere are we burying him?Ó he asked. ÒThe forest?Ó 
ÒBlimey, no,Ó said Hagrid, wiping
 his streaming eyes on the bot-
tom of his shirt. ÒThe other spid
ers wonÕ let me anywhere near 
their webs now AragogÕs gone. Turn
s out it was onÕy on his orders 
they didnÕ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?Ó 
The honest answer was ÒyesÓ; Ha
rry recalled with painful ease 
the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acro-
mantulas: They had been quite cl
ear that Aragog
 was the only 
thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid. 
ÒNever bin an area oÕ the forest 
I couldnÕ go before!Ó said Hagrid, 
shaking his head. ÒIt wasnÕ easy, gettinÕ AragogÕs body out oÕ there, 
I can tell yeh Ñ they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted 
ter give Õim a nice burial . 
. . a proper send-off . . .Ó He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his 
elbow, saying as he did so (for the 
potion seemed to indicate that it 
was the right thing to do), ÒPro
fessor Slughorn met me coming 
down here, Hagrid.Ó 
ÒNot in trouble, are yeh?Ó said
 Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. 
ÒYeh shouldnÕ be outta the castle in
 the eveninÕ, I know it, itÕs my 
fault ÑÓ 
ÒNo, no, when he heard what I was doing he said heÕd like to 
come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,Ó said Harry. ÒHeÕs 
gone to change into something more
 suitable, I think . . . and he 
said heÕd bring some bottles so
 we can drink to AragogÕs mem-
ory. . . . 
ÒDid he?Ó said Hagrid, looking 
both astonished and touched.  
 $1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .<:" ÒThaÕs Ñ thaÕs righÕ nice of him, that is, anÕ not turninÕ yeh in ei-
ther. IÕve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. 
. . . CominÕ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . heÕdÕve 
liked that, Aragog would. . . .Ó 
Harry thought privately that wh
at Aragog would have liked 
most about Slughorn was the ample 
amount of edible flesh he pro-
vided, but he merely moved to th
e rear window of HagridÕs hut, 
where he saw the rather horrible si
ght of the enormous dead spider 
lying on its back outside, it
s legs curled and tangled. 
ÒAre we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?Ó 
ÒJusÕ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,Ó said Hagrid in a 
choked voice. ÒIÕve already dug 
the Ñ yeh know Ñ grave. JusÕ 
thought weÕd say a few nice thin
gs over him Ñ happy memories, 
yeh know ÑÓ 
His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, 
and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted 
handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, 
several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. 
ÒHagrid,Ó he said, in a deep, gr
ave voice. ÒSo very sorry to hear 
of your loss.Ó 
ÒThaÕs very nice of yeh,Ó said 
Hagrid. ÒThanks a lot. AnÕ thanks 
fer not givinÕ Harry dete
ntion neither. . . .Ó 
ÒWouldnÕt have dreamed of it,Ó 
said Slughorn. ÒSad night, sad 
night . . . Where is 
the poor creature?Ó 
ÒOut here,Ó said Hagrid in a sh
aking voice. ÒShall we Ñ shall 
we do it, then?Ó 
The three of them stepped out in
to the back garden. The moon 
was glistening palely through the 
trees now, and its rays mingled  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .<." with the light spilling from HagridÕs window to illuminate AragogÕs 
body lying on the edge of a ma
ssive pit beside a ten-foot-high 
mound of freshly dug earth. 
ÒMagnificent,Ó said Slughorn, approaching the spiderÕs head, 
where eight milky eyes stared bl
ankly at the sk
y and two huge, 
curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought 
he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, ap-
parently examining the 
enormous hairy head. 
ÒItÕs not evÕryone appreciates how 
beauÕiful they are,Ó said Ha-
grid to SlughornÕs back, tears 
leaking from the corners of his 
crinkled eyes. ÒI didnÕ know yeh we
re intÕrested in creatures like 
Aragog, Horace.Ó 
ÒInterested? My dear Hagrid, I 
revere them,Ó said Slughorn, 
stepping back from the body. Harr
y saw the glint of a bottle disap-
pear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once 
more, noticed nothing. ÒNow . . . 
shall we proceed to the burial?Ó 
Hagrid nodded and moved forward.
 He heaved the gigantic spi-
der into his arms and, with an en
ormous grunt, rolled it into the 
dark pit. It hit the bottom with 
a rather horrible, crunchy thud. 
Hagrid started to cry again. 
ÒOf course, itÕs difficult for you, who knew him best,Ó said 
Slughorn, who like Harry could reac
h no higher than HagridÕs el-
bow, but patted it all the same
. ÒWhy donÕt I say a few words?Ó 
He must have got a lot of g
ood quality venom from Aragog, 
Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a 
satisfied smirk as he stepped up 
to the rim of the pit and said, in a 
slow, impressive voice, ÒFarewell, 
Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those 
who knew you wonÕt forget! Though your body will decay, your  
 $1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .<;" spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. 
May your many-eyed descendants 
ever flourish and your human 
friends find solace for the 
loss they have sustained.Ó 
ÒThaÕ was . . . thaÕ was . . . beauÕiful!Ó howled Hagrid, and he 
collapsed onto the compost heap
, crying harder than ever. 
ÒThere, there,Ó said Slughorn, wavi
ng his wand so that the huge 
pile of earth rose up and then fel
l, with a muffled sort of crash, 
onto the dead spider, forming a 
smooth mound. ÒLetÕs get inside 
and have a drink. Get on his other 
side, Harry. . . . 
ThatÕs it. . . . 
Up you come, Hagrid . 
. . Well done . . .Ó 
They deposited Hagrid in a chai
r at the table. Fang, who had 
been skulking in his basket duri
ng the burial, now came padding 
softly across to them and put his
 heavy head into HarryÕs lap as 
usual. Slughorn uncorked one of
 the bottles of wine he had 
brought. 
ÒI have had it 
all tested for poison,Ó he assured Harry, pouring 
most of the first bottle into one 
of HagridÕs bucket-sized mugs and 
handing it to Hagrid. ÒHad a house-
elf taste every bottle after what 
happened to your poor friend Rupert.Ó 
Harry saw, in his mindÕs eye, th
e expression on HermioneÕs face 
if she ever heard about this abuse 
of house-elves, and decided never 
to mention it to her. 
ÒOne for Harry . . .Ó said Slughorn
, dividing a second bottle be-
tween two mugs, Ò. . . and one for me. WellÓ Ñ he raised his mug 
high Ñ Òto Aragog.Ó 
ÒAragog,Ó said Harry and Hagrid together. 
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank 
deeply. Harry, however, with 
the way ahead illuminated for him by
 Felix Felicis, knew that he  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .</" must not drink, so he merely pret
ended to take a gulp and then set 
the mug back on the 
table before him. 
ÒI had him from an egg, yeh know
,Ó said Hagrid morosely. ÒTiny 
little thing he was when he hatched.
 ÕBout the size of a Pekingese.Ó 
ÒSweet,Ó said Slughorn. 
ÒUsed ter keep him in a cupboard
 up at the school until . . . 
well . . .Ó 
HagridÕs face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had 
contrived to have Hagrid thrown 
out of school, blamed for open-
ing the Chamber of Secrets. Slugho
rn, however, did not seem to be 
listening; he was looking up at the 
ceiling, from which a number of 
brass pots hung, and also a long, 
silky skein of bright white hair. 
ÒThatÕs never unicorn hair, Hagrid?Ó 
ÒOh, yeah,Ó said Hagrid indifferently. ÒGets pulled out of their 
tails, they catch it on branches anÕ 
stuff in the forest, yeh know . . .Ó 
ÒBut my dear chap, do you know how much thatÕs 
worth?Ó ÒI use it fer bindinÕ on bandages anÕ stuff if a creature gets in-
jured,Ó said Hagrid, shrugging. ÒI
tÕs dead useful . . . very strong, 
see.Ó Slughorn took another deep dr
aught from his mug, his eyes 
moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for 
more treasures that he might be ab
le to convert into a plentiful sup-
ply of oak-matured mead, crystali
zed pineapple, and velvet smok-
ing jackets. He refilled HagridÕs
 mug and his own, and questioned 
him about the creatures that lived 
in the forest these days and how 
Hagrid was able to lo
ok after them all. Hagrid, becoming expan-
sive under the influence of the dr
ink and SlughornÕs flattering in-
terest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long 
explanation of bowt
ruckle husbandry. 
$1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .<6" The Felix Felicis gave 
Harry a little nudge at 
this point, and he 
noticed that the supply of drink 
that Slughorn had brought was 
running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Re-
filling Charm without saying the 
incantation aloud, but the idea 
that he might not be able to do 
it tonight was la
ughable: Indeed, 
Harry grinned to himself as, unnoti
ced by either Hagrid or Slug-
horn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he 
pointed his wand under the table at
 the emptying bottles and they 
immediately began to refill. 
After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extrav-
agant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and 
to Ñ 
ÒHarry Potter!Ó bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his four-
teenth bucket of wine down 
his chin as he drained it. 
ÒYes, indeed,Ó cried Slughorn a 
little thickly, ÒParry Otter, the 
Chosen Boy Who Ñ well Ñ something of that sort,Ó he mum-
bled, and drained his mug too. 
Not long after this, Hagrid beca
me tearful again and pressed the 
whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, 
who pocketed it with cries of, 
ÒTo friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!Ó 
And for a while after that, Hagrid 
and Slughorn were sitting side 
by side, arms around each other,
 singing a slow sad song about a 
dying wizard called Odo. 
ÒAaargh, the good die young,Ó muttered Hagrid, slumping low 
onto the table, a little cross-eyed
, while Slughorn continued to war-
ble the refrain. ÒMe dad was no ag
e ter go . . . nor were yer mum 
anÕ dad, Harry. . .Ó 
Great fat tears oozed out of the co
rners of HagridÕs crinkled eyes 
again; he grasped Harry
Õs arm and shook it. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .<<" ÒBesÕ wiz and witchard oÕ their 
age I never knew . . . terrible 
thing . . . terribl
e thing . . .Ó 
And Odo the hero, they
 bore him back home 
To the place that he
Õd known as a lad,
 sang Slughorn plaintively. 
They laid him to rest with his hat inside out 
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.
 Ò. . . terrible,Ó Hagrid grunted, 
and his great shaggy head rolled 
sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply. 
ÒSorry,Ó said Slughorn with a hiccu
p. ÒCanÕt carry a tune to save 
my life.Ó 
ÒHagrid wasnÕt talking about your singing,Ó said Harry quietly. 
ÒHe was talking about my
 mum and dad dying.Ó ÒOh,Ó said Slughorn, repressing a 
large belch. ÒOh dear. Yes, that 
was Ñ was terrible indeed. Te
rrible . . . terrible . . .Ó 
He looked quite at a loss for what 
to say, and resorted to refilling 
their mugs. 
ÒI donÕt Ñ donÕt suppose you re
member it, Harry?Ó he asked 
awkwardly. 
ÒNo Ñ well, I was only one when they died,Ó said Harry, his 
eyes on the flame of the candle fl
ickering in HagridÕs heavy snores. 
ÒBut IÕve found out pretty much wh
at happened since. My dad died 
first. Did you know that?Ó 
ÒI Ñ I didnÕt,Ó said Slughorn in a hushed voice. 
ÒYeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his 
body toward my mum,Ó said Harry. 
$1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .<0" Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear 
his horrified gaze away from HarryÕs face. 
ÒHe told her to get out of the 
way,Ó said Harry remorselessly. 
ÒHe told me she neednÕt have died. He only wanted me. She could 
have run.Ó ÒOh dear,Ó breathed Slughorn. ÒS
he could have . . . she neednÕt 
. . . ThatÕs awful. . . .Ó ÒIt is, isnÕt it?Ó said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. 
ÒBut she didnÕt move. Dad was al
ready dead, but she didnÕt want 
me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort . . . but he just 
laughed. . . .Ó 
ÒThatÕs enough!Ó said Slughorn
 suddenly, raising a shaking 
hand. ÒReally, my dear boy, enough . . . IÕm an old man . . . I donÕt 
need to hear . . . I donÕ
t want to hear . . .Ó 
ÒI forgot,Ó lied Harry, Felix Fe
licis leading him on. ÒYou liked 
her, didnÕt you?Ó 
ÒLiked her?Ó said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once 
more. ÒI donÕt imagine anyone wh
o met her wouldnÕt have liked 
her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny
 . . . It was the most horrible 
thing. . . .Ó 
ÒBut you wonÕt help her son,Ó said
 Harry. ÒShe gave me her life, 
but you wonÕt give me a memory.Ó 
HagridÕs rumbling snores filled 
the cabin. Harry looked steadily 
into SlughornÕs tear-filled eyes. 
The Potions master seemed unable 
to look away. 
ÒDonÕt say that,Ó he whispered. ÒIt isnÕt a question . . . If it were 
to help you, of course . . . but 
no purpose can be
 served . . .Ó ÒIt can,Ó said Harry clearly. ÒD
umbledore needs information. I 
need information.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&)-"
 .07" He knew he was safe: Felix was 
telling him that Slughorn would 
remember nothing of this in 
the morning. Looking Slughorn 
straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little. 
ÒI am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.Ó 
Slughorn turned paler than ev
er; his shiny forehead gleamed 
with sweat. 
ÒYou 
are the Chosen One?Ó 
ÒOf course I am,Ó 
said Harry calmly. 
ÒBut then . . . my dear boy . . . youÕre asking a great deal . . . 
youÕre asking me, in fact, to aid 
you in your attempt to destroy ÑÓ 
ÒYou donÕt want to get rid of th
e wizard who killed Lily Evans?Ó 
ÒHarry, Harry, of course I do, but ÑÓ 
ÒYouÕre scared heÕll find out you helped me?Ó 
Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified. 
ÒBe brave like my moth
er, Professor. . . .Ó 
Slughorn raised a pudg
y hand and pressed his shaking fingers to 
his mouth; he looked for a moment
 like an enormously overgrown 
baby. ÒI am not proud . . .Ó he whispe
red through his fingers. ÒI am 
ashamed of what Ñ of what that 
memory shows. . . . I think I may 
have done great damage that day. . . .Ó 
ÒYouÕd cancel out anything you 
did by giving me the memory,Ó 
said Harry. ÒIt would be a very
 brave and noble thing to do.Ó 
Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry 
stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, 
long silence, but Felix Felicis told
 Harry not to break it, to wait. 
Then, very slowly, Slughorn pu
t his hand in his pocket and 
pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and 
took out a small, empty bottle. 
Still looking into HarryÕs eyes, 
$1&'(""&#'""23(4$5"
 .08" Slughorn touched the tip of his wa
nd to his temple and withdrew 
it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging 
to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it 
broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered 
it into the bottle where 
it coiled, then spread, 
swirling like gas. He 
corked the bottle with a trembl
ing hand and then passed it across 
the table to Harry. 
ÒThank you very much, Professor.Ó 
ÒYouÕre a good boy,Ó said Profe
ssor Slughorn, te
ars trickling 
down his fat cheeks into his walrus
 mustache. ÒAnd youÕve got her 
eyes. . . . Just donÕt thin
k too badly of me once youÕve seen it. . . .Ó 
And he too put his head on his 
arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell 
asleep.

   arry could feel the Felix Felici
s wearing off as he crept 
back into the castle. The 
front door had remained un-
locked for him, but on the third fl
oor he met Peeves and only nar-
rowly avoided detection by diving
 sideways through one of his 
shortcuts. By the time he got up to
 the portrait of the Fat Lady and 
pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he
 was not surprised to find her in 
a most unhelpful mood. 
ÒWhat sort of time 
do you call this?Ó 
ÒIÕm really sorry Ñ I had to go
 out for something important ÑÓ 
ÒWell, the password changed at mi
dnight, so youÕll just have to 
sleep in the corridor, wonÕt you?Ó 
ÒYouÕre joking!Ó said Harry. ÒWhy did it have to change at 
midnight?Ó 
ÒThatÕs the way it is,Ó said the 
Fat Lady. ÒIf youÕre angry, go 
and take it up with the headmaster, heÕs the one whoÕs tightened 
security.Ó 
#"#0(!(12'3" -.4" ÒFantastic,Ó said Harry bitterly, l
ooking around at the hard floor. 
ÒReally brilliant. Yeah, I would go
 and take it up with Dumbledore 
if he was here, because heÕs 
the one who wanted me to ÑÓ 
ÒHe is here,Ó said a voice be
hind Harry. ÒProfessor Dumbledore 
returned to the scho
ol an hour ago.Ó 
Nearly Headless Nick 
was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-
bling as usual upon his ruff. 
ÒI had it from the Bloody Baro
n, who saw him arrive,Ó said 
Nick. ÒHe appeared, according to th
e Baron, to be in good spirits, 
though a little tire
d, of course.Ó 
ÒWhere is he?Ó said Ha
rry, his heart leaping. 
ÒOh, groaning and clanking up 
on the Astronomy Tower, itÕs a 
favorite pastime of his ÑÓ 
ÒNot the Bloody Baron Ñ Dumbledore!Ó 
ÒOh Ñ in his office,Ó said Nick. 
ÒI believe, from what the Baron 
said, that he had business to at
tend to before turning in ÑÓ 
ÒYeah, he has,Ó said Harry, excite
ment blazing in his chest at the 
prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He 
wheeled about and sprinted off ag
ain, ignoring the Fat Lady who 
was calling after him. 
ÒCome back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! 
The passwordÕs still ÔtapewormÕ!Ó 
But Harry was already hurtling
 back along the corridor and 
within minutes, he was saying Òt
offee ”clairsÓ to DumbledoreÕs gar-
goyle, which leapt aside, permitti
ng Harry entrance onto the spiral 
staircase. ÒEnter,Ó said Dumbledore wh
en Harry knocked. He sounded 
exhausted. 
Harry pushed open the door. There was DumbledoreÕs office, 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 -.-" looking the same as ever, but with
 black, star-strewn skies beyond 
the windows. 
ÒGood gracious, Harry,Ó said Dumb
ledore in surprise. ÒTo what 
do I owe this very late pleasure?Ó 
ÒSir Ñ IÕve got it. IÕve got 
the memory from Slughorn.Ó 
Harry pulled out the tiny glass bot
tle and showed it to Dumble-
dore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then 
his face split in
 a wide smile. 
ÒHarry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew 
you could do it!Ó 
All thought of the lateness of the 
hour apparently forgotten, he 
hurried around his desk, took the 
bottle with SlughornÕs memory 
in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept 
the Pensieve. 
ÒAnd now,Ó said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his 
desk and emptying the contents of 
the bottle into it
. ÒNow, at last, 
we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .Ó 
Harry bowed obediently over the P
ensieve and felt his feet leave 
the office floor. . . . Once agai
n he fell through darkness and 
landed in Horace SlughornÕs office many years before. 
There was the much younger Slug
horn, with his thick, shiny, 
straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in 
the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon 
a velvet pouffe, a small glass of
 wine in one hand, the other rum-
maging in a box of crystalized pi
neapple. And there were the half-
dozen teenage boys sitting around
 Slughorn with Tom Riddle in 
the midst of them, MarvoloÕs gold-and-black ring gleaming on his 
finger. 
 #0(!(12'3" -.5" Dumbledore landed beside Harry just
 as Riddle asked, ÒSir, is it 
true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?Ó 
ÒTom, Tom, if I knew I couldnÕt
 tell you,Ó said Slughorn, wag-
ging his finger reprovingly at Ri
ddle, though winking at the same 
time. ÒI must say, IÕd like to kn
ow where you get your information, 
boy, more knowledgeable than
 half the staff, you are.Ó 
Riddle smiled; the other boys la
ughed and cast him admiring 
looks. 
ÒWhat with your uncanny ability 
to know things you shouldnÕt, 
and your careful flattery of the 
people who matter Ñ thank you for 
the pineapple, by 
the way, youÕre quite right,
 it is my favorite ÑÓ 
Several of the boys
 tittered again. 
ÒÑ I confidently expect you to ri
se to Minister of Magic within 
twenty years. Fifteen, if you k
eep sending me pineapple, I have 
ex-cellent contacts at the Ministry.Ó 
Tom Riddle merely smiled as th
e others laughed again. Harry 
noticed that he was by no means 
the eldest of the group of boys, 
but that they all seemed to 
look to him as their leader. 
ÒI donÕt know that politics would suit me, sir,Ó he said when the 
laughter had died away. ÒI donÕt ha
ve the right kind of background, 
for one thing.Ó 
A couple of the boys around him
 smirked at each other. Harry 
was sure they were enjoying a 
private joke, undoubtedly about 
what they knew, or suspected, rega
rding their gang leaderÕs famous 
ancestor. 
ÒNonsense,Ó said Slughorn briskly, ÒcouldnÕt be plainer you 
come from decent Wizarding stock, 
abilities like yours. No, youÕll 
go far, Tom, IÕve never been wrong about a student yet.Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 -.6" The small golden clock standing 
upon SlughornÕs desk chimed 
eleven oÕclock behind hi
m and he looked around. 
ÒGood gracious, is it that time already? YouÕd better get going, 
boys, or weÕll all be in trouble. Le
strange, I want your essay by to-
morrow or itÕs detention. 
Same goes for you, Avery.Ó 
One by one, the boys filed out 
of the room. Slughorn heaved 
himself out of his armchair and ca
rried his empty glass over to his 
desk. A movement behind him ma
de him look around; Riddle was 
still standing there. 
ÒLook sharp, Tom, you donÕt want
 to be caught 
out of bed out 
of hours, and you a prefect . . .Ó 
ÒSir, I wanted to ask you something.Ó 
ÒAsk away, then, mÕboy, ask away. . . .Ó 
ÒSir, I wondered what you know
 about . . . ab
out Horcruxes?Ó 
Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caress-
ing the stem of his wine glass. 
ÒProject for Defense Agains
t the Dark Arts, is it?Ó 
But Harry could tell that Slughorn 
knew perfectly we
ll that this 
was not schoolwork. 
ÒNot exactly, sir,Ó said Riddle.
 ÒI came across the term while 
reading and I didnÕt fully understand it.Ó 
ÒNo . . . well . . . youÕd be hard
-pushed to find a book at Hog-
warts thatÕll give you details on 
Horcruxes, Tom, thatÕs very Dark 
stuff, very Dark ind
eed,Ó said Slughorn. 
ÒBut you obviously know all abou
t them, sir? I mean, a wizard 
like you Ñ sorry, I mean, if you canÕt tell me, obviously Ñ I just 
knew if anyone could tell me, yo
u could Ñ so I ju
st thought IÕd 
ask ÑÓ 
It was very well done, thought Ha
rry, the hesitancy, the casual 
#0(!(12'3" -.7" tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had 
too much experience of trying to
 wheedle information out of re-
luctant people not to recognize a ma
ster at work. He could tell that 
Riddle wanted the information ve
ry, very much; perhaps had been 
working toward this 
moment for weeks. 
ÒWell,Ó said Slughorn, not lookin
g at Riddle, bu
t fiddling with 
the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, Òwell, it canÕt 
hurt to give you an overview, of co
urse. Just so that you understand 
the term. A Horcrux is the word us
ed for an object in which a per-
son has concealed part
 of their soul.Ó 
ÒI donÕt quite understand how th
at works, though, sir,Ó said 
Riddle. 
His voice was carefully controll
ed, but Harry could sense his 
excitement. 
ÒWell, you split your soul, yo
u see,Ó said Slughorn, Òand hide 
part of it in an object outside th
e body. Then, even if oneÕs body is 
attacked or destroyed, one cannot di
e, for part of the soul remains 
earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a 
form . . .Ó 
SlughornÕs face crumpled and 
Harry found himself remember-
ing words he had heard nearly two years before: Ò
I was ripped from 
my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost 
. . .
 but still, 
I was alive.
Ó Ò. . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be pre-
ferable.Ó 
But RiddleÕs hunger was now a
pparent; his expression was 
greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. 
ÒHow do you split your soul?Ó ÒWell,Ó said Slughorn uncomfor
tably, Òyou must understand 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 -.8" that the soul is supposed to remain
 intact and whole. Splitting it is 
an act of violation, it
 is against nature.Ó 
ÒBut how do you do it?Ó 
ÒBy an act of evil Ñ the supreme act of evil. By committing 
murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creat-
ing a Horcrux would use the damage
 to his advantage: He would 
encase the torn portion ÑÓ 
ÒEncase? But how Ñ ?Ó 
ÒThere is a spell, do not ask me
, I donÕt know!Ó said Slughorn, 
shaking his head like an old elep
hant bothered by mosquitoes. ÒDo 
I look as though I have tried 
it Ñ do I look li
ke a killer?Ó 
ÒNo, sir, of course not,Ó said Riddle quickly. ÒIÕm sorry . . . I 
didnÕt mean to offend . . .Ó 
ÒNot at all, not at al
l, not offended,Ó said Slughorn gruffly. ÒItÕs 
natural to feel some curiosity abou
t these things. . . . Wizards of 
a certain caliber have always be
en drawn to that aspect of 
magic. . . .Ó 
ÒYes, sir,Ó said Riddle. ÒWhat I 
donÕt understand, though Ñ just 
out of curiosity Ñ I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can 
you only split your soul once? Wo
uldnÕt it be better, make you 
stronger, to have your soul in more
 pieces, I mean, for instance, isnÕt 
seven the most powerfully magica
l number, wouldnÕt seven Ñ ?Ó 
ÒMerlinÕs beard, Tom!Ó yelped Slughorn. ÒSeven! IsnÕt it bad 
enough to think of killing one pe
rson? And in any case . . . bad 
enough to divide the soul
 . . . but to rip it in
to seven pieces . . .Ó 
Slughorn looked deeply troubled
 now: He was gazing at Riddle 
as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could 
tell that he was regre
tting entering into the 
conversation at all. 
 #0(!(12'3" -.." ÒOf course,Ó he muttered, Òthis 
is all hypothetical, what weÕre 
discussing, isnÕt it? 
All academic . . .Ó 
ÒYes, sir, of course,Ó said Riddle quickly. 
ÒBut all the same, Tom . . . keep it
 quiet, what IÕve told Ñ thatÕs 
to say, what weÕve discussed. Peop
le wouldnÕt like to think weÕve 
been chatting about Horcruxes. It
Õs a banned subject at Hogwarts, 
you know. . . . DumbledoreÕs particularly fierce ab
out it. . . .Ó 
ÒI wonÕt say a word, sir,Ó said Ri
ddle, and he left, but not before 
Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-
piness it had worn when he had fi
rst found out that he was a wiz-
ard, the sort of happiness that
 did not enhance his handsome 
features, but made them, so
mehow, less human. . . . 
ÒThank you, Harry,Ó said Dumbledo
re quietly. ÒLet us go. . . .Ó 
When Harry landed back on the 
office floor Dumbledore was 
already sitting down behind his de
sk. Harry sat too and waited for 
Dumbledore to speak. 
ÒI have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long 
time,Ó said Dumbledore at last. ÒIt confirms the theory on which I 
have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far 
there is still to go. . . .Ó 
Harry suddenly noticed that every 
single one of the old head-
masters and headmistresses in the 
portraits around the walls was 
awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-
nosed wizard had actually 
taken out an ear trumpet. 
ÒWell, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore, 
ÒI am sure you understood the 
significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, 
give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to 
find out how to make himself immortal.Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 599" ÒYou think he succeeded then, sir?Ó asked Harry. ÒHe made a 
Horcrux? And thatÕs why he didn
Õt die when he attacked me? He 
had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?Ó 
ÒA bit . . . or more,Ó said Du
mbledore. ÒYou heard Voldemort: 
What he particularly wanted from
 Horace was an 
opinion on what 
would happen to the wizard who cr
eated more than one Horcrux, 
what would happen to 
the wizard so determined to evade death 
that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul re-
peatedly, so as to store it in ma
ny, separately concealed Horcruxes. 
No book would have given him th
at information. As far as I 
know Ñ as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew Ñ no wizard had 
ever done more than tear his soul in two.Ó 
Dumbledore paused for a moment
, marshaling 
his thoughts, 
and then said, ÒFour years ago, I re
ceived what I considered certain 
proof that Voldemort 
had split his soul.Ó 
ÒWhere?Ó asked Harry ÒHow?Ó 
ÒYou handed it to me, Harry,Ó 
said Dumbledore. ÒThe diary, 
RiddleÕs diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the 
Chamber of Secrets.Ó 
ÒI donÕt understand, 
sir,Ó said Harry. 
ÒWell, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-
ary, what you described to me 
was a phenomenon I had never wit-
nessed. A mere memory starting to 
act and think for itself? A mere 
memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had 
fallen? No, something much more 
sinister had live
d inside that 
book. . . . a fragment of soul, I wa
s almost sure of 
it. The diary had 
been a Horcrux. But this raised as
 many questions as it answered. 
ÒWhat intrigued and alarmed me 
most was that that diary had 
been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.Ó 
#0(!(12'3" 59:" ÒI still donÕt understand,Ó said Harry. 
ÒWell, it worked as a Horcrux 
is supposed to work Ñ in other 
words, the fragment of soul conc
ealed inside it 
was kept safe and 
had undoubtedly played its part 
in preventing the death of its 
owner. But there could be no doubt 
that Riddle really wanted that 
diary read, wanted the piece of hi
s soul to inhabit or possess some-
body else, so that Sl
ytherinÕs monster would be unleashed again.Ó 
ÒWell, he didnÕt want his hard work to be wasted,Ó said Harry. 
ÒHe wanted people to know he was SlytherinÕs heir, because he 
couldnÕt take cred
it at the time.Ó 
ÒQuite correct,Ó said Dumbledore,
 nodding. ÒBut donÕt you see, 
Harry, that if he intended the dia
ry to be passed to, or planted on, 
some future Hogwarts student, 
he was being remarkably blas” 
about that precious fragment of 
his soul concealed within it. The 
point of a Horcrux is, as Professor 
Slughorn explained, to keep part 
of the self hidden and safe, not to fl
ing it into somebody elseÕs path 
and run the risk that they might destroy it Ñ as indeed happened: 
That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. 
ÒThe careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux 
seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have 
made Ñ or been planning to make Ñ more Horcruxes, so that the 
loss of his first would not be so de
trimental. I did not wish to be-
lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. 
ÒThen you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-
mort returned to his body, he ma
de a most illuminating and alarm-
ing statement to his Death Eaters. Ô
I, who have gone further than 
anybody along the path that leads to immortality.
Õ That was what you 
told me he said. Ô
Further than anybody,
Õ And I thought I knew what 
that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 59/" his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the 
plural, Harry, which I do not be-
lieve any other wizard has ever ha
d. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort 
has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the 
transformation he has undergone s
eemed to me to be only explica-
ble if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might 
call Ôusual evilÕ . . .Ó 
ÒSo heÕs made himself impossible to kill by murdering other peo-
ple?Ó said Harry. ÒWhy couldnÕt he 
make a SorcererÕs Stone, or steal 
one, if he was so interested in immortality?Ó 
ÒWell, we know that he tried to 
do just that, five years ago,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒBut there are several reasons why, I think, a Sor-
cererÕs Stone would appe
al less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. 
ÒWhile the Elixir of Life does in
deed extend life, it must be 
drunk regularly, for all eternity, if
 the drinker is to maintain their 
immortality. Therefore, Voldemor
t would be entirely dependent 
on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or
 was contaminated, or if the Stone 
was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes 
to operate alone, remember. I beli
eve that he woul
d have found the 
thought of being dependent, even 
on the Elixir, intolerable. Of 
course he was prepared to drink it
 if it would take him out of the 
horrible part-life to which he wa
s condemned after 
attacking you, 
but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended 
to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing 
more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-
mortal, you see . . . or as close 
to immortal as any man can be. 
ÒBut now, Harry, armed with this
 information, the crucial mem-
ory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-
cret of finishing Lord Voldemort 
than anyone has ever been before. 
You heard him, Harry: ÔWouldnÕt it 
be better, make you stronger, 
#0(!(12'3" 594" to have your soul in more pieces 
. . . isnÕt seven the most powerfully 
magical number . . .Õ 
IsnÕt seven the most powerfully magical number. 
Yes, I think the idea of
 a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to 
Lord Voldemort.Ó 
ÒHe made 
seven Horcruxes?Ó said Harry, horror-struck, while 
several of the portraits on the wa
lls made similar noises of shock 
and outrage. ÒBut they could 
be anywhere in the world Ñ 
hidden Ñ buried or
 invisible ÑÓ 
ÒI am glad to see you appreciate
 the magnitude of the problem,Ó 
said Dumbledore calmly ÒBut fi
rstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-
cruxes: six. The seventh part of 
his soul, however maimed, resides 
inside his regenerated body. That 
was the part of him that lived a 
spectral existence for so many year
s during his exile; without that, 
he has no self at all. That seve
nth piece of soul will be the last 
that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack Ñ the piece 
that lives in his body.Ó 
ÒBut the six Horcruxes, then,Ó said Harry, a little desperately, 
Òhow are we suppose
d to find them?Ó 
ÒYou are forgetting . . . you have
 already destroyed one of them. 
And I have destroyed another.Ó 
ÒYou have?Ó said Harry eagerly. 
ÒYes indeed,Ó said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, 
burned-looking hand. ÒThe ring, 
Harry. MarvoloÕs ring. And a ter-
rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been Ñ forgive me the 
lack of seemly modesty Ñ for my
 own prodigious skill, and for 
Professor SnapeÕs timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-
perately injured, I might not have 
lived to tell the tale. However, a 
withered hand does not seem an 
unreasonable exchange for a sev-
enth of VoldemortÕs soul. The ri
ng is no longer a Horcrux.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 59-" ÒBut how did you find it?Ó 
ÒWell, as you now know, for many years I have made it my busi-
ness to discover as much as I can about VoldemortÕs past life. I have 
traveled widely, visiting those pl
aces he once knew. I stumbled 
across the ring hidden in the ruin of the GauntsÕ house. It seems 
that once Voldemort had succeeded in
 sealing a piece of his soul in-
side it, he did not want to wear it
 anymore. He hid it, protected by 
many powerful enchantments, in 
the shack where his ancestors had 
once lived (Morfin having been cart
ed off to Azkaban, of course), 
never guessing that I might one da
y take the trouble to visit the 
ruin, or that I might be keeping an
 eye open for traces of magical 
concealment. 
ÒHowever, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. 
You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our 
theory of a seven-part soul
, four Horcruxes remain.Ó 
ÒAnd they could be anything?Ó 
said Harry. ÒThey could be old 
tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .Ó 
ÒYou are thinking of Portkeys, 
Harry, which must
 be ordinary 
objects, easy to overlook. But woul
d Lord Voldemort use tin cans or 
old potion bottles to guard his 
own precious soul? You are for-
getting what I have showed you. 
Lord Voldemort liked to collect 
trophies, and he preferred objects 
with a powerful magical history. 
His pride, his belief in his own su
periority, his determination to 
carve for himself a startling place 
in magical history; these things 
suggest to me that Voldemort 
would have chosen his Horcruxes 
with some care, favoring ob
jects worthy of the honor.Ó 
ÒThe diary wasnÕt that special.Ó 
ÒThe diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the  
 #0(!(12'3" 595" Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-
pendous importance.Ó 
ÒSo, the other Horcruxes?Ó said 
Harry. ÒDo you think you know 
what they are, sir?Ó 
ÒI can only guess,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒFor the reasons I have al-
ready given, I believe that Lord
 Voldemort would prefer objects 
that, in themselves, have a cert
ain grandeur. I have therefore 
trawled back through VoldemortÕs pa
st to see if I can find evidence 
that such artifacts have disappeared around him.Ó 
ÒThe locket!Ó said Harry loudly. ÒHufflepuffÕs cup!Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore, smiling, 
ÒI would be prepared to bet Ñ 
perhaps not my other hand Ñ but a co
uple of fingers, that they be-
came Horcruxes three and four. 
The remaining two, assuming 
again that he created a total of six,
 are more of a problem, but I will 
hazard a guess that, having secu
red objects from Hufflepuff and 
Slytherin, he set out to track dow
n objects owned by Gryffindor or 
Ravenclaw. Four objects from the 
four founders would, I am sure, 
have exerted a powerful pull over VoldemortÕs imagination. I can-
not answer for whether he ever 
managed to find anything of 
RavenclawÕs. I am confident, howeve
r, that the only known relic of 
Gryffindor remains safe.Ó 
Dumbledore pointed his blackened 
fingers to the wall behind 
him, where a ruby-encrusted swor
d reposed within a glass case. 
ÒDo you think thatÕs why he really wanted to come back to Hog-
warts, sir?Ó said Harry. ÒTo try an
d find something from one of the 
other founders?Ó 
ÒMy thoughts precisely,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒBut unfortunately, 
that does not advance us much furthe
r, for he was turned away, or  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 596" so I believe, without the chance to 
search the school. I am forced to 
conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four 
foundersÕ objects. He definitely
 had two Ñ he 
may have found 
three Ñ that is the best
 we can do for now.Ó 
ÒEven if he got something of Rave
nclawÕs or of GryffindorÕs, that 
leaves a sixth Horcrux,Ó said Harr
y, counting on his fingers. ÒUn-
less he got both?Ó 
ÒI donÕt think so,Ó said Dumbledore
. ÒI think I know what the sixth 
Horcrux is. I wonder what you wi
ll say when I confess that I have 
been curious for a while about the 
behavior of the 
snake, Nagini?Ó 
ÒThe snake?Ó said Harry, startl
ed. ÒYou can use animals as 
Horcruxes?Ó 
ÒWell, it is inadvisa
ble to do so,Ó said Dumbledore, Òbecause to 
confide a part of your soul to 
something that can think and move 
for itself is obviously 
a very risky business. However, if my calcula-
tions are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of 
his goal of six when he entered yo
ur parentsÕ house with the inten-
tion of killing you. 
ÒHe seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for 
particularly significant deaths. Yo
u would certainly have been that. 
He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the 
prophecy had outlined. He believ
ed he was making himself invin-
cible. I am sure that he was in
tending to make his final Horcrux 
with your death. 
ÒAs we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, 
he used Nagini to kill an old Mu
ggle man, and it might then have 
occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines 
the Slytherin connection, which en
hances Lord VoldemortÕs mys-
tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; 
#0(!(12'3" 597" he certainly likes to keep her clos
e, and he seems to have an un-
usual amount of control over 
her, even for a Parselmouth.Ó 
ÒSo,Ó said Harry, Òthe diaryÕs gone,
 the ringÕs gone. The cup, the 
locket, and the snake are still inta
ct, and you think there might be 
a Horcrux that was once RavenclawÕs or GryffindorÕs?Ó 
ÒAn admirably succinct and accu
rate summary, yes,Ó said Dum-
bledore, bowing his head. 
ÒSo . . . are you still looking for 
them, sir? Is that where youÕve 
been going when youÕve been leaving the school?Ó 
ÒCorrect,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI ha
ve been looking for a very long 
time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding an-
other one. There ar
e hopeful signs.Ó 
ÒAnd if you do,Ó said Harry quic
kly, Òcan I come with you and 
help get rid of it?Ó 
Dumbledore looked at Harry very 
intently for a moment before 
saying, ÒYes, I think so.Ó 
ÒI can?Ó said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. 
ÒOh yes,Ó said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. ÒI think you have 
earned that right.Ó 
Harry felt his heart lift. It was 
very good not to hear words of 
caution and protection for on
ce. The headmasters and head-
mistresses around the 
walls seemed less impressed by DumbledoreÕs 
decision; Harry saw a few of them 
shaking their heads and Phineas 
Nigellus actually snorted. 
ÒDoes Voldemort know when a Ho
rcrux is destroyed, sir? Can 
he feel it?Ó Harry asked,
 ignoring the portraits. 
ÒA very interesting question, Harry.
 I believe not. I believe that 
Voldemort is now so immersed in 
evil, and these crucial parts of 
himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 598" Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but 
he was not aware, for instance, th
at the diary had 
been destroyed 
until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort 
discovered that the diary had been
 mutilated and robbed of all its 
powers, I am told that his an
ger was terrible to behold.Ó 
ÒBut I thought he meant Lucius 
Malfoy to smuggle it into Hog-
warts?Ó ÒYes, he did, years ago, when he 
was sure he would be able to 
create more Horcruxes, but still 
Lucius was supposed to wait for 
VoldemortÕs say-so, and he never 
received it, for Voldemort van-
ished shortly after gi
ving him the diary. 
ÒNo doubt he thought that Luci
us would not dare do anything 
with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting 
too much upon LuciusÕs fear of a master who had been gone for years 
and whom Lucius believed dead. 
Of course, Lucius did not know 
what the diary really was. I unders
tand that Voldemort had told him 
the diary would cause the Chamber of 
Secrets to reopen because it was 
cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-
terÕs soul in his hands, he would 
undoubtedly have treated it with 
more reverence Ñ but instead he went ahead and carried out the old 
plan for his own ends: By planting
 the diary upon Arthur WeasleyÕs 
daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-
inating magical object in one stroke
. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with 
VoldemortÕs fury about th
e fact that he threw aw
ay the Horcrux for his 
own gain, and the fiasco at the Mini
stry last year, I would not be sur-
prised if he is not secretly glad to
 be safe in Azkaban at the moment.Ó 
Harry sat in thought for a moment, 
then asked, ÒSo if all of his 
Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort 
could
 be killed?Ó 
ÒYes, I think so,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒWithout his Horcruxes, 
#0(!(12'3" 59." Voldemort will be a mortal man 
with a maimed and diminished 
soul. Never forget, though, that w
hile his soul may be damaged be-
yond repair, his brain and his magica
l powers remain intact. It will 
take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort 
even without his Horcruxes.Ó 
ÒBut I havenÕt got uncommon skill and power,Ó said Harry, be-
fore he could stop himself. 
ÒYes, you have,Ó said Dumbledore firmly. ÒYou have a power 
that Voldemort has never had. You can ÑÓ 
ÒI know!Ó said Harry impatiently. ÒI
 can love!Ó It was only with 
difficulty that he
 stopped himself a
dding, ÒBig deal!Ó 
ÒYes, Harry, you can love,Ó said
 Dumbledore, who looked as 
though he knew perfectly well wh
at Harry had just refrained from 
saying. ÒWhich, given everything th
at has happened to you, is a 
great and remarkable thing. You ar
e still too young to understand 
how unusual you are, Harry.Ó 
ÒSo, when the prophecy says that IÕll have Ôpower the Dark Lord 
knows not,Õ it just means Ñ love?Ó
 asked Harry, feeling a little let 
down. ÒYes Ñ just love,Ó said Dumble
dore. ÒBut Harry, never forget 
that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort 
made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled 
you out as the person who woul
d be most dangerous to him Ñ 
and in doing so, he 
made
 you the person who 
would be most dan-
gerous to him!Ó 
ÒBut it comes to the same ÑÓ 
ÒNo, it doesnÕt!Ó said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. 
Pointing at Harry with his black, 
withered hand, he said, ÒYou are 
setting too much stor
e by the prophecy!Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 5:9" ÒBut,Ó spluttered Harry, Òbut 
you said the prop
hecy means ÑÓ 
ÒIf Voldemort had never heard of
 the prophecy, would it have 
been fulfilled? Would it have mean
t anything? Of course not! Do 
you think every prophecy in the 
Hall of Prophecy has been ful-
filled?Ó 
ÒBut,Ó said Harry, bewildered, Òbut
 last year, you said one of us 
would have to kill the other ÑÓ 
ÒHarry, Harry, only because Vold
emort made a grave error, and 
acted on Professor TrelawneyÕs words! If Voldemort had never mur-
dered your father, would he have 
imparted in you a furious desire 
for revenge? Of course not! If he 
had not forced your mother to die 
for you, would he have given you 
a magical protecti
on he could not 
penetrate? Of course not, Harry! 
DonÕt you see? Voldemort himself 
created his worst enemy, just as 
tyrants everywhere do! Have you 
any idea how much tyrants fear th
e people they oppress? All of 
them realize that, one day, amongs
t their many victims, there is 
sure to be one who rises against 
them and strikes back! Voldemort 
is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who 
would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-
tion, with the result that he no
t only handpicked the man most 
likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!Ó 
ÒBut ÑÓ 
ÒIt is essential that you understand this!Ó said Dumbledore, 
standing up and striding about 
the room, his glittering robes 
swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. ÒBy 
attempting to kill you, Voldemor
t himself singled out the remark-
able person who sits here in fron
t of me, and gave 
him the tools for 
the job! It is VoldemortÕs fault th
at you were able to see into his 
thoughts, his ambitions, that yo
u even understand the snakelike 
#0(!(12'3" 5::" language in which he gives orde
rs, and yet, Harry, despite your 
privileged insight into VoldemortÕ
s world (which, incidentally, is a 
gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-
duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-
est desire to become one 
of VoldemortÕ
s followers!Ó 
ÒOf course I havenÕt!Ó said Ha
rry indignantly. ÒHe killed my 
mum and dad!Ó 
ÒYou are protected, in short, by 
your ability to love!Ó said Dum-
bledore loudly. ÒThe only protection that can possibly work against 
the lure of power like VoldemortÕs!
 In spite of all the temptation 
you have endured, all the suffering,
 you remain pure of heart, just 
as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-
ror that reflected your heartÕs de
sire, and it showed you only the 
way to thwart Lord Voldemort, 
and not immortality or riches. 
Harry, have you any idea how fe
w wizards could have seen what 
you saw in that mirror? Voldemor
t should have known then what 
he was dealing with, but he did not! 
ÒBut he knows it now. You have
 flitted into Lord VoldemortÕs 
mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-
out enduring mortal agony, as he 
discovered in the Ministry. I do 
not think he understands why, Ha
rry, but then, he was in such a 
hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the 
incomparable power of a soul th
at is untarnished and whole.Ó 
ÒBut, sir,Ó said Harry, making va
liant efforts not to sound argu-
mentative, Òit all comes 
to the same thing, doesnÕt it? IÕve got to try 
and kill him, or ÑÓ 
ÒGot to?Ó said Dumbledore. ÒOf 
course youÕve got to! But not 
because of the prophecy! Because you,
 yourself, will never rest until 
youÕve tried! We both know it! Im
agine, please, just for a moment, 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,&#(''"
 5:/" that you had never heard that pr
ophecy! How would you feel about 
Voldemort now? Think!Ó 
Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of 
him, and thought. He thought of hi
s mother, his father, and Sirius. 
He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds 
he knew Lord Voldemort had done. 
A flame seemed to leap inside 
his chest, sear
ing his throat. 
ÒIÕd want him finished,Ó said Ha
rry quietly. ÒAnd IÕd want to do 
it.Ó ÒOf course you would!Ó cried 
Dumbledore. ÒYou see, the 
prophecy does not mean you 
have to do anything! But the 
prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to 
mark you as his equal. 
. . . In 
other words, you are free to choose
 your way, quite free to turn 
your back on the prophecy! But 
Voldemort continue
s to set store 
by the prophecy. He will continue 
to hunt you . . . which makes it 
certain, really, that ÑÓ 
ÒThat one of us is going to end 
up killing the other,Ó said Harry. 
ÒYes.Ó 
But he understood at last what
 Dumbledore had been trying to 
tell him. It was, he thought,
 the difference between being dragged 
into the arena to face a battle 
to the death and walking into the 
arena with your head 
held high. Some people, perhaps, would say 
that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-
dore knew Ñ 
and so do I,
 thought Harry, with a rush of fierce 
pride, and so did my parents
 Ñ that there was al
l the difference in 
the world.

   xhausted but delighted with his nightÕs work, Harry told 
Ron and Hermione everything 
that had happ
ened during 
next morningÕs Charms lesson (having first cast the 
Muffliato
 spell 
upon those nearest them). They we
re both satisfyingly impressed 
by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and pos-
itively awed when he told them 
about VoldemortÕs Horcruxes and 
DumbledoreÕs promise to take Harry along, should he find an-
other one. 
ÒWow,Ó said Ron, when Harry ha
d finally finished telling them 
everything; Ron was waving his wa
nd very vaguely in the direction 
of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what 
he was doing. ÒWow. YouÕre actual
ly going to go with Dumbledore 
. . . and try and de
stroy . . . wow.Ó ÒRon, youÕre making it snow,Ó said Hermione patiently, grab-
bing his wrist and redirecting his 
wand away from the ceiling from 
which, sure enough, large white flak
es had started to fall. Lavender 
'"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 015" Brown, Harry noticed, glared at
 Hermione from a neighboring 
table through very red eyes, and He
rmione immediately let go of 
RonÕs arm. 
ÒOh yeah,Ó said Ron, looking do
wn at his shoulders in vague 
surprise. ÒSorry . . . looks like
 weÕve all got horrible dandruff 
now. . . .Ó 
He brushed some of the fake snow off HermioneÕs shoulder. 
Lavender burst into tears. Ron l
ooked immensely guilty and turned 
his back on her. 
ÒWe split up,Ó he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth. 
ÒLast night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with 
Hermione. Obviously she couldnÕt 
see you, so she thought it had 
just been the two of us.Ó 
ÒAh,Ó said Harry. ÒWell Ñ you 
donÕt mind itÕs over, do you?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó Ron admitted. ÒIt was pre
tty bad while she was yelling, 
but at least I didnÕt have to finish it.Ó 
ÒCoward,Ó said Hermione, though 
she looked amused. ÒWell, it 
was a bad night for romance all ar
ound. Ginny and Dean split up 
too, Harry.Ó 
Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she 
told him that, but she could not 
possibly know that his insides 
were suddenly dancing the conga.
 Keeping his face as immobile 
and his voice as indifferent as he
 could, he aske
d, ÒHow come?Ó 
ÒOh, something really silly . . . Sh
e said he was always trying to 
help her through the portrait hole
, like she couldnÕt climb in her-
self . . . but theyÕve been
 a bit rocky for ages.Ó 
Harry glanced over at Dean on th
e other side of the classroom. 
He certainly looked unhappy. 
 3'!&/43'4%($" 010" ÒOf course, this puts you in a bit 
of a dilemma, doesnÕt it?Ó said 
Hermione. 
ÒWhat dÕyou mean?Ó sa
id Harry quickly. 
ÒThe Quidditch team,Ó said Hermione. ÒIf Ginny and Dean 
arenÕt speaking . . .Ó 
ÒOh Ñ oh yeah,Ó said Harry. 
ÒFlitwick,Ó said Ron in a warnin
g tone. The tiny little Charms 
master was bobbing his way towa
rd them, and Hermione was the 
only one who had managed to turn
 vinegar into wine; her glass 
flask was full of deep crimson li
quid, whereas the contents of 
HarryÕs and RonÕs were
 still murky brown. 
ÒNow, now, boys,Ó squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. ÒA 
little less talk, a little 
more action . . . Let me
 see you try. . . .Ó 
Together they raised their wand
s, concentrating with all their 
might, and pointed them at their flasks. HarryÕs vinegar turned to 
ice; RonÕs flask exploded. 
ÒYes . . . for homework,Ó said 
Professor Flitwick, reemerging 
from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his 
hat, Òpractice.
Ó They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and 
walked back to the common room 
together. Ron seemed to be pos-
itively lighthearted about the end 
of his relationship with Laven-
der, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what 
she was grinning about sh
e simply said, ÒItÕs a nice day.Ó Neither of 
them seemed to have noticed that 
a fierce battle was raging inside 
HarryÕs brain: 
SheÕs RonÕs sister.
 But sheÕs ditched Dean! 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 016" SheÕs still RonÕs sister.
 IÕm his best mate! 
ThatÕll make it worse.
 If I talked to
 him first Ñ 
HeÕd hit you.
 What if I donÕt care? 
HeÕs your best mate
! Harry barely noticed that they 
were climbing through the por-
trait hole into the sunny common
 room, and only vaguely regis-
tered the small group of seventh 
years clustered to
gether there, 
until Hermione cried, ÒKatie! YouÕre back! Are you okay?Ó 
Harry stared: It was indeed Ka
tie Bell, looking completely 
healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends. 
ÒIÕm really well!Ó she said ha
ppily. ÒThey let me out of St. 
MungoÕs on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum 
and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just 
telling me about McLaggen and th
e last match, Harry. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry, Òwell, now yo
uÕre back and RonÕs fit, weÕll 
have a decent chance of thrash
ing Ravenclaw, which means we 
could still be in the running fo
r the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .Ó 
He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even 
drove Ginny temporarily from his 
brain. He dropped his voice as 
KatieÕs friends started gathering up their things; apparently they 
were late for Tr
ansfiguration. Ò. . . that necklace . . . can you 
remember who gave it to you now?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Katie, shaking her 
head ruefully. ÒEveryoneÕs been 
asking me, but I havenÕt got a clue. The last thing I remember was 
walking into the 
ladiesÕ in the Three Broomsticks.Ó 
ÒYou definitely went into the 
bathroom, then?Ó 
said Hermione. 
3'!&/43'4%($" 017" ÒWell, I know I pushed open the door,Ó said Katie, Òso I suppose 
whoever Imperiused me was standing
 just behind it. After that, my 
memoryÕs a blank until about two w
eeks ago in St. MungoÕs. Listen, 
IÕd better go, I wouldnÕt put it past McGonagall to give me lines 
even if it is my first day back. . . .Ó 
She caught up her ba
g and books and hurrie
d after her friends, 
leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione
 to sit down at a window table 
and ponder what she had told them. 
ÒSo it must have been a girl 
or a woman who gave Katie the 
necklace,Ó said Hermione, Òto 
be in the ladiesÕ bathroom.Ó 
ÒOr someone who looked like a girl or a woman,Ó said Harry. 
ÒDonÕt forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hog-
warts. We know some of
 it got stolen. . . .Ó 
In his mindÕs eye, he watched 
a parade of Crabbes and Goyles 
prance past, all transformed into girls. 
ÒI think IÕm going to 
take another swig of Felix,Ó said Harry, 
Òand have a go at the R
oom of Requirement again.Ó 
ÒThat would be a complete waste of potion,Ó said Hermione 
flatly, putting down the copy of 
SpellmanÕs Syllabary
 she had just 
taken out of her bag. ÒLuck can only
 get you so far, Harry. The sit-
uation with Slughorn 
was different; you always
 had the ability to 
persuade him, you just needed to 
tweak the circumstances a bit. 
Luck isnÕt enough to get you th
rough a powerful enchantment, 
though. DonÕt go wasting the rest of
 that potion! YouÕll need all the 
luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . .Ó She 
dropped her voice 
to a whisper. 
ÒCouldnÕt we make some more
?Ó Ron asked Harry, ignoring 
Hermione. ÒItÕd be great to have a 
stock of it. . . . 
Have a look in 
the book . . .Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 018" Harry pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag 
and looked up Felix Felicis. 
ÒBlimey, itÕs seriously complicated,Ó he said, running an eye 
down the list of ingredients. ÒAnd 
it takes six months . . . YouÕve 
got to let it stew. . . .Ó 
ÒTypical,Ó said Ron. 
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed 
the corner of a page folded dow
n; turning to it, he saw the 
Sectum-sempra spell, captioned ÒFor Enemies,Ó that he had marked a few 
weeks previously. He had still not 
found out what it did, mainly 
because he did not want to test 
it around Hermione, but he was 
considering trying it out on Mc
Laggen next time he came up be-
hind him unawares. 
The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie 
Bell back at school was Dean Thom
as, because he would no longer 
be required to fill her place as 
Chaser. He took th
e blow stoically 
enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but 
Harry had the distinct feeling as 
he walked away that Dean and 
Seamus were muttering muti
nously behind his back. 
The following fortnight saw the 
best Quidditch practices Harry 
had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of 
McLaggen, so glad to ha
ve Katie back at last, that they were flying 
extremely well. 
Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; 
on the contrary, she was the life 
and soul of the team. Her imita-
tions of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal 
posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders 
at McLaggen before being knocke
d out cold, kept them all highly 
amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an 
3'!&/43'4%($" 019" innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more 
Bludger injuries during practice
 because he had not been keeping 
his eyes on the Snitch. 
The battle still raged inside his head: 
Ginny or Ron
? Sometimes 
he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much 
if he asked Ginny out, but then 
he remembered RonÕs expression 
when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would 
consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . . 
Yet Harry could not help himself
 talking to Ginny, laughing 
with her, walking back from prac
tice with her; however much his 
conscience ached, he found himself
 wondering how best to get her 
on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another 
of his little parties, for Ron wo
uld not be around Ñ but unfortu-
nately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice 
Harry considered asking for Hermio
neÕs help, but he
 did not think 
he could stand seeing the smug l
ook on her face; he thought he 
caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny 
or laughing at her jokes. And to 
complicate matters, he had the 
nagging worry that if he didnÕt do it
, somebody else was sure to ask 
Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that 
she was too popular 
for her own good. 
All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was 
becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Her-
mione put it, Òtweaking the circum
stancesÓ? The balmy days slid 
gently through May, and Ron seemed
 to be there at HarryÕs shoul-
der every time he saw Ginny. Ha
rry found himself longing for a 
stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that noth-
ing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister 
falling for each other and to leav
e them alone together for longer 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 0:;" than a few seconds. There seemed no
 chance of either while the fi-
nal Quidditch game of the season 
was looming; Ron wanted to talk 
tactics with Harry all the time an
d had little thou
ght for anything 
else. Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-
Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the 
school, for the match would deci
de the Championship, which was 
still wide open. If Gryffindor beat
 Ravenclaw by a margin of three 
hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his 
team to fly better) then they woul
d win the Championship. If they 
won by less than three hundred po
ints, they would come second to 
Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hund
red points they would be third be-
hind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they 
would be in fourth place and no
body, Harry thought, would ever, 
ever let him forget that it had 
been he who had 
captained Gryffin-
dor to their first bottom-of-the-
table defeat in 
two centuries. 
The run-up to this crucial ma
tch had all the usual features: 
members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams 
in the corridors; unpleasant chan
ts about individual players being 
rehearsed loudly as they passed; 
the team members 
themselves ei-
ther swaggering around enjoying al
l the attention or else dashing 
into bathrooms between classes to
 throw up. Somehow, the game 
had become inextricably linked 
in HarryÕs mind with success or 
failure in his plans for Ginny. He co
uld not help feeling that if they 
won by more than three hundred 
points, the scenes of euphoria 
and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty 
swig of Felix Felicis. 
In the midst of all his preoccupa
tions, Harry had not forgotten 
his other ambition: finding out wh
at Malfoy was up to in the 
3'!&/43'4%($" 0:1" Room of Requirement. He was stil
l checking the MarauderÕs Map, 
and as he was unable to locate Ma
lfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy 
was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry 
was losing hope that he would ev
er succeed in getting inside the 
Room of Requirement, he attemp
ted it whenever he was in the 
vicinity, but no matter how he re
worded his request, the wall re-
mained firmly doorless. 
A few days before the match ag
ainst Ravenclaw, Harry found 
himself walking down to dinner 
alone from the common room, 
Ron having rushed off into a nea
rby bathroom to throw up yet 
again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector 
about a mistake she thought she migh
t have made in her last Arith-
mancy essay. More out of habit 
than anything, Harry made his 
usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Ma-
rauderÕs Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy 
anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of 
Requirement again, but then he saw MalfoyÕs tiny, labeled dot 
standing in a boysÕ bathroom on 
the floor below, accompanied, not 
by Crabbe or Goyle, 
but by Moaning Myrtle. 
Harry only stopped staring at th
is unlikely coupling when he 
walked right into a suit of armo
r. The loud crash brought him out 
of his reverie; hurrying from the sc
ene lest Filch turn up, he dashed 
down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Out-
side the bathroom, he
 pressed his ear agai
nst the door. He could 
not hear anything. He very qu
ietly pushed the door open. Draco Malfoy was standing with 
his back to the door, his hands 
clutching either side 
of the sink, his whit
e-blond head bowed. 
ÒDonÕt,Ó crooned Moaning MyrtleÕs
 voice from one of the cubi-
cles. ÒDonÕt . . . tell me whatÕs 
wrong . . . I can help you. . . .Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 0::" ÒNo one can help me,Ó said Ma
lfoy. His whole body was shak-
ing. ÒI canÕt do it. . . . I canÕt. . 
. . It wonÕt work . . . and unless I do 
it soon . . . he says 
heÕll kill me. . . .Ó And Harry realized, with a shock so
 huge it seemed to root him 
to the spot, that Malfoy was crying Ñ actually crying Ñ tears 
streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped 
and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the 
cracked mirror and sa
w Harry staring at hi
m over his shoulder. 
Malfoy wheeled around, drawing 
his wand. Instinctively, Harry 
pulled out his own. MalfoyÕs hex 
missed Harry by 
inches, shatter-
ing the lamp on the wall beside 
him; Harry threw himself sideways, 
thought 
Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, 
but Malfoy blocked the 
jinx and raised his wand for another Ñ 
ÒNo! No! Stop it!Ó squealed Mo
aning Myrtle, her voice echoing 
loudly around the tile
d room. ÒStop! STOP!Ó 
There was a loud bang and 
the bin behind Harry exploded; 
Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse 
that backfired off the wall be-
hind MalfoyÕs ear and smashed th
e cistern beneath Moaning Myr-
tle, who screamed loudly; wate
r poured everywhere and Harry 
slipped as Malfoy, his fa
ce contorted, cried, Ò
Cruci ÑÓ 
ÒSECTUMSEMPRA!Ó bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his 
wand wildly. 
Blood spurted from MalfoyÕs face
 and chest as though he had 
been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and 
collapsed onto the waterlogged floo
r with a great splash, his wand 
falling from his limp right hand. 
ÒNo ÑÓ gasped Harry. 
Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged  
 3'!&/43'4%($" 0:2" toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands 
scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest. 
ÒNo Ñ I didnÕt ÑÓ 
Harry did not know what he was sa
ying; he fell to his knees be-
side Malfoy, who was shaking uncont
rollably in a pool of his own 
blood. Moaning Myrtle let out 
a deafening scream: ÒMURDER! 
MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!Ó 
The door banged open behind 
Harry and he looked up, terri-
fied: Snape had burst into the r
oom, his face livid. Pushing Harry 
roughly aside, he knelt over Malf
oy, drew his wand, and traced it 
over the deep wounds HarryÕs cu
rse had made, muttering an in-
cantation that sounded almost like
 song. The flow of blood seemed 
to ease; Snape wiped the residue fr
om MalfoyÕs face and repeated 
his spell. Now the wounds 
seemed to be knitting. 
Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely 
aware that he too was soaked in
 blood and water. Moaning Myrtle 
was still sobbing and wailing 
overhead. When Snape had per-
formed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy 
into a standing position. 
ÒYou need the hospital wing. Th
ere may be a certain amount of 
scarring, but if you take dittany 
immediately we mi
ght avoid even 
that. . . . Come. . . .Ó He supported Malfoy across the 
bathroom, turning at the door 
to say in a voice of cold fury, ÒAnd
 you, Potter . . . You wait here for 
me.Ó 
It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up 
slowly, shaking, and looked dow
n at the wet floor. There were 
bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 0:5" could not even find it in himsel
f to tell Moaning Myrtle to be 
quiet, as she continued to wail 
and sob with increasingly evident 
enjoyment. 
Snape returned ten minutes later.
 He stepped into the bathroom 
and closed the 
door behind him. 
ÒGo,Ó he said to Myrtle, and she 
swooped back into her toilet at 
once, leaving a ringing silence behind her. 
ÒI didnÕt mean it to happen,Ó 
said Harry at once. His voice 
echoed in the cold, watery space. 
ÒI didnÕt know what that spell 
did.Ó But Snape ignored this. ÒApparently I underestimated you, Pot-
ter,Ó he said quietly. ÒWho wo
uld have thought you knew such 
Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?Ó 
ÒI Ñ read about it somewhere.Ó 
ÒWhere?Ó 
ÒIt was Ñ a library b
ook,Ó Harry invented wildly. ÒI canÕt re-
member what it was call ÑÓ 
ÒLiar,Ó said Snape. HarryÕs throat
 went dry. He knew what Snape 
was going to do and he had never 
been able to prevent it. . . . 
The bathroom seemed 
to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled 
to block out all thou
ght, but try as he might, the Half-Blood 
PrinceÕs copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 swam hazily to the fore-
front of his mind. 
And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this 
wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into SnapeÕs black eyes, hop-
ing against hope that 
Snape had not seen wh
at he feared, but Ñ 
ÒBring me your schoolbag,Ó said
 Snape softly, Òand all of your 
schoolbooks. 
All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!Ó 
There was no point arguing. Harr
y turned at once and splashed 
3'!&/43'4%($" 0:0" out of the bathroom. Once in the 
corridor, he broke into a run to-
ward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way; 
they gaped at him, drenched in 
water and blood, but he answered 
none of the questions fire
d at him as he ran past. 
He felt stunned; it was as thou
gh a beloved pet had turned sud-
denly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a 
spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? 
Would he tell Slughorn Ñ HarryÕs stomach churned Ñ how 
Harry had been achieving such good 
results in Potions all year? 
Would he confiscate or destroy th
e book that had 
taught Harry so 
much . . . the book th
at had become a kind of guide and friend? 
Harry could not let it happen
. . . . He could not . . . 
ÒWhereÕve you Ñ ? Why are 
you soaking Ñ ? Is that 
blood?Ó Ron was standing at the top of th
e stairs, looking bewildered at 
the sight of Harry. 
ÒI need your book,Ó Harry panted. ÒYour Potions book. Quick 
. . . give it to me . . .Ó 
ÒBut what about 
the Half-Blood ÑÓ 
ÒIÕll explain later!Ó 
Ron pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag 
and handed it over; Harry sprinted
 off past him and back to the 
common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed 
looks of several people who had al
ready finished their dinner, threw 
himself back out of the portrait
 hole, and hurtled off along the 
seventh-floor corridor. 
He skidded to a halt 
beside the tapestry of 
dancing trolls, closed 
his eyes, and began to walk. 
I need a place to hide my book.

!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 0:6" Three times he walked up and do
wn in front of the stretch of 
blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door 
to the Room of Requirement. 
Harry wrenched it open, flung him-
self inside, and slammed it shut. 
He gasped. Despite his haste, his 
panic, his fear of what awaited 
him back in the bathroom, he coul
d not help but be overawed by 
what he was looking at. He was st
anding in a room the size of a 
large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light 
down upon what looked like a city
 with towering walls, built of 
what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hog-
warts inhabitants. There were alle
yways and roads bordered by tee-
tering piles of broken and da
maged furniture, stowed away, 
perhaps, to hide the evidence of mi
shandled magic, or else hidden 
by castle-proud house-elves. Th
ere were thousands and thousands 
of books, no doubt banned or gr
affitied or stolen. There were 
winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees
, some still with enough life in 
them to hover halfheartedly over 
the mountains of other forbidden 
items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, 
cloaks; there were what looked like
 dragon eggshells, corked bottles 
whose contents still shimmered evi
lly, several rusting swords, and a 
heavy, bloodstained axe. 
Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between 
all this hidden treasure. He turned
 right past an enormous stuffed 
troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabi-
net in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally paus-
ing beside a large cupboard that se
emed to have had acid thrown at 
its blistered surface. He opened 
one of the cupboardÕs creaking 
doors: It had already been used as 
a hiding place for 
something in a 
cage that had long since died; its 
skeleton had five legs. He stuffed 
3'!&/43'4%($" 0:7" the Half-Blood PrinceÕs book be
hind the cage and slammed the 
door. He paused for a moment, his
 heart thumping
 horribly, gaz-
ing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot 
again amidst all this junk? Seizing 
the chipped bust of an ugly old 
warlock from on top of a nearby 
crate, he stood it on top of the 
cupboard where the book was now 
hidden, perched a dusty old wig 
and a tarnished tiara on the statueÕs
 head to make it more distinc-
tive, then sprinted back through 
the alleyways of hidden junk as 
fast as he could go, back to th
e door, back out onto the corridor, 
where he slammed the door behind him
, and it turned 
at once back 
into stone. 
Harry ran flat-out toward the 
bathroom on the floor below, 
cramming RonÕs copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 into his bag as he 
did so. A minute later, he was back
 in front of Snape, who held out 
his hand wordlessly for HarryÕs schoolbag. Harry handed it over, 
panting, a searing pain in
 his chest, and waited. 
One by one, Snape extracted HarryÕs books and examined them. 
Finally, the only book left was 
the Potions book, which he looked 
at very carefully before speaking. 
ÒThis is your copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 is it, Potter?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry, 
still breathing hard. 
ÒYouÕre quite sure of 
that, are you, Potter?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry, with
 a touch more defiance. 
ÒThis is the copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 that you purchased 
from Flourish 
and Blotts?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry firmly. 
ÒThen why,Ó asked Snape, Òdoes 
it have the name ÔRoonil Waz-
libÕ written inside
 the front cover?Ó 
HarryÕs heart missed a beat. ÒT
hatÕs my nickname,Ó he said. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 0:8" ÒYour nickname,Ó repeated Snape. 
ÒYeah . . . thatÕs what my fr
iends call me,Ó said Harry. 
ÒI understand what a nickname is
,Ó said Snape. The cold, black 
eyes were boring once more into HarryÕs; he tried not to look into 
them. 
Close your mind.
 . . . 
Close your mind.
 . . . But he had never 
learned how to do it properly. . . . 
ÒDo you know what I think, Potter?Ó said Snape, very quietly. ÒI 
think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention 
with me every Saturday until the end of term. What do you think, 
Potter?Ó ÒI Ñ I donÕt agree, sir,Ó said Ha
rry, still refusing to look into 
SnapeÕs eyes. 
ÒWell, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,Ó said 
Snape. ÒTen oÕclock Saturday 
morning, Potter. My office.Ó 
ÒBut sir . . .Ó said Harry, lookin
g up desperately. ÒQuidditch . . . 
the last match 
of the . . .Ó ÒTen oÕclock,Ó whispered Snape, 
with a smile that showed his 
yellow teeth. ÒPoor Gryffindor . . . fourth place this year, I 
fear . . .Ó 
And he left the bathroom with
out another word, leaving Harry 
to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than 
Ron had ever felt in his life. 
ÒI wonÕt say ÔI told you so,ÕÓ said Hermione, an hour later in the 
common room. 
ÒLeave it, Hermione,Ó said Ron angrily. 
Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He 
had just finished telling Ron, 
Hermione, and Ginny what had hap-
pened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news 
had traveled very fast: Apparently
 Moaning Myrtle had taken it 
3'!&/43'4%($" 0:9" upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the 
story; Malfoy had already been vi
sited in the hospital wing by 
Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no 
time in vilifying Harry far and 
wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. 
Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure 
fifteen highly unpleasant minute
s in the company of Professor 
McGonagall, who had told him he 
was lucky not to have been ex-
pelled and that she supported wh
oleheartedly SnapeÕs punishment 
of detention every Saturday
 until the end of term. 
ÒI told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,Ó 
Hermione said, evidently unable to 
stop herself. ÒAnd I was right, 
wasnÕt I?Ó 
ÒNo, I donÕt think 
you were,Ó said Harry stubbornly. 
He was having a bad enough ti
me without Hermione lecturing 
him; the looks on the Gryffindor 
teamÕs faces when he had told 
them he would not be able to pl
ay on Saturday had been the worst 
punishment of all. He could feel 
GinnyÕs eyes on him now but did 
not meet them; he di
d not want to see disappointment or anger 
there. He had just told her that 
she would be playin
g Seeker on Sat-
urday and that Dean would be rejo
ining the team as Chaser in her 
place. Perhaps, if they won, Gi
nny and Dean would make up dur-
ing the post-match euphoria. . 
. . The thought went through 
Harry like an ic
y knife. . . . 
ÒHarry,Ó said Hermione, Òhow can you still stick up for that 
book when that spell ÑÓ 
ÒWill you stop harping on ab
out the book!Ó 
snapped Harry. 
ÒThe Prince only copied it out! ItÕs not like he was advising anyone 
to use it! For all we know, he was 
making a note of something that 
had been used against him!Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 02;" ÒI donÕt believe this,Ó said He
rmione. ÒYouÕre actually defend-
ing ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm not defending what I did!Ó 
said Harry quickly. ÒI wish I 
hadnÕt done it, and not just beca
use IÕve got about a dozen deten-
tions. You know I wouldnÕtÕve used
 a spell like that, not even on 
Malfoy, but you canÕt blame the Prin
ce, he hadnÕt written Ôtry this 
out, itÕs really goodÕ Ñ he was ju
st making notes for himself, wasnÕt 
he, not for anyone else. . . .Ó 
ÒAre you telling me,Ó said Hermione, Òthat youÕre going to go 
back Ñ ?Ó 
ÒAnd get the book? Yeah, I am,Ó said Harry forcefully. ÒListen, 
without the Prince IÕd never have 
won the Felix Felicis. IÕd never 
have known how to save Ron from
 poisoning, IÕd never have ÑÓ 
ÒÑ got a reputation for Potions brilliance you donÕt deserve,Ó 
said Hermione nastily. 
ÒGive it a rest, Hermione!Ó said Ginny, and Harry was so 
amazed, so grateful, he looked up
. ÒBy the sound of it, Malfoy was 
trying to use an Unforgivable Cu
rse, you should be glad Harry had 
something good up
 his sleeve!Ó 
ÒWell, of course IÕm glad Harry 
wasnÕt cursed!Ó said Hermione, 
clearly stung. ÒBut yo
u canÕt call that Sect
umsempra spell good, 
Ginny, look where itÕs landed him! And IÕd have thought, seeing 
what this has done to your chances in the match ÑÓ 
ÒOh, donÕt start acting as thou
gh you understand Quidditch,Ó 
snapped Ginny, ÒyouÕll on
ly embarrass yourself.Ó 
Harry and Ron stared: Hermione 
and Ginny, who had always 
got on together very well, were no
w sitting with their arms folded, 
glaring in opposite directions. Ro
n looked nervously at Harry, then 
snatched up a book at random an
d hid behind it. Harry, however, 
3'!&/43'4%($" 021" little though he knew he deserved 
it, felt unbeliev
ably cheerful all 
of a sudden, even though none of th
em spoke again for the rest of 
the evening. 
His lightheartedness was short-
lived. There were Slytherin 
taunts to be endured next day, 
not to mention much anger from 
fellow Gryffindors, who were most
 unhappy that their Captain had 
got himself banned from
 the final match of the season. By Saturday 
morning, whatever he might ha
ve told Hermione, Harry would 
have gladly exchanged all the Felix 
Felicis in the world to be walk-
ing down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. 
It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students 
streaming out into the sunshine, 
all of them wearing rosettes and 
hats and brandishing 
banners and scarves, 
to descend the stone 
steps into the dungeons and walk 
until the distant sounds of the 
crowd were quite obliterated, knowin
g that he would not be able to 
hear a word of commenta
ry or a cheer or groan. 
ÒAh, Potter,Ó said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door 
and entered the unpleasantly famili
ar office that Snape, despite 
teaching floors above now, had not 
vacated; it was as dimly lit as 
ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored 
potions all around the walls. Om
inously, there were many cob-
webbed boxes piled on a table wh
ere Harry was clearly supposed to 
sit; they had an aura of tediou
s, hard, and pointless work about 
them. ÒMr. Filch has been looking for 
someone to clear out these old 
files,Ó said Snape softly. ÒThey ar
e the records of other Hogwarts 
wrongdoers and thei
r punishments. Where the ink has grown 
faint, or the cards have suffered 
damage from mice, we would like 
you to copy out the crimes and 
punishments afresh and, making 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 02:" sure that they are in alphabetical 
order, replace them in the boxes. 
You will not use magic.Ó 
ÒRight, Professor,Ó said Harry, wi
th as much contempt as he 
could put into the la
st three syllables. 
ÒI thought you could start,Ó said 
Snape, a malicious smile on his 
lips, Òwith boxes one thousand an
d twelve to one thousand and 
fifty-six. You will find some famili
ar names in there, which should 
add interest to the task
. Here, you see . . .Ó 
He pulled out a card from one of
 the topmost boxes with a flour-
ish and read, ÒÔ
James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an 
illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. AubreyÕs head twice normal size. 
Double detention.
ÕÓ Snape sneered. ÒIt must be such a comfort to 
think that, though they are gone, 
a record of thei
r great achieve-
ments remains. . . .Ó 
Harry felt the familiar boiling se
nsation in the pit of his stom-
ach. Biting his tongue to prevent 
himself retaliating, he sat down in 
front of the boxes and pulled one toward him. 
It was, as Harry had anticipated,
 useless, boring work, punctu-
ated (as Snape had clearly planne
d) with the regular jolt in the 
stomach that meant he had just read his father or SiriusÕs names, 
usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally ac-
companied by those of Remus Lu
pin and Peter Pettigrew. And 
while he copied out all their vari
ous offenses and punishments, he 
wondered what was going on outs
ide, where the match would have 
just started . . . Ginny play
ing Seeker agai
nst Cho . . . 
Harry glanced again and again at 
the large clock ticking on the 
wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps 
Snape had bewitched it to go extr
a slowly? He could not have been 
here for only half an hour . . . an 
hour . . . an hour
 and a half. . . . 
3'!&/43'4%($" 022" HarryÕs stomach started rumbling 
when the clock showed half 
past twelve. Snape, who had not 
spoken at all since setting Harry 
his task, finally looked up at ten past one. 
ÒI think that will do,Ó he said coldly. ÒMark the place you have 
reached. You will continue at ten oÕclock next Saturday.Ó 
ÒYes, sir.Ó 
Harry stuffed a bent card into 
the box at random and hurried 
out of the door before Snape coul
d change his mind, racing back 
up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, 
but all was quiet. . . . 
It was over, then. . . . 
He hesitated outside the crowde
d Great Hall, then ran up the 
marble staircase; whether Gryffi
ndor had won or lost, the team 
usually celebrated or commiser
ated in their own common room. 
ÒQuid agis
?Ó he said tentatively to 
the Fat Lady, wondering what 
he would find inside. 
Her expression was unreadable 
as she replied, ÒYouÕll see.Ó 
And she swung forward. 
A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry 
gaped as people began to scream 
at the sight of him; several hands 
pulled him into the room. 
ÒWe won!Ó yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the 
silver Cup at Harry. ÒWe won! Four
 hundred and fifty to a hundred 
and forty! We won!Ó 
Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she 
had a hard, blazing look in her fa
ce as she threw her arms around 
him. And without thinking, withou
t planning it, without worrying 
about the fact that fifty people 
were watching, Ha
rry kissed her. 
After several long moments Ñ or 
it might have 
been half an 
hour Ñ or possibly several sunlit
 days Ñ they broke apart. The 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./("
 025" room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and 
there was an outbreak of nervous
 giggling. Harry looked over the 
top of GinnyÕs head to see Dean 
Thomas holding a shattered glass 
in his hand, and Romilda Vane lo
oking as though she might throw 
something. Hermione was beaming,
 but HarryÕs eyes sought Ron. 
At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an ex-
pression appropriate to having b
een clubbed over the head. For a 
fraction of a second they
 looked at each other,
 then Ron gave a tiny 
jerk of the head that 
Harry understood to mean, 
Well 
Ñ if you 
must. The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at 
Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long 
walk in the grounds seemed indica
ted, during which Ñ if they had 
time Ñ they might discuss the match.

   he fact that Harry Potter 
was going out with Ginny 
Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most 
of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervi-
ous to gossip over the next few weeks.
 After all, it made a very nice 
change to be talked about becaus
e of something that was making 
him happier than he could rememb
er being for a very long time, 
rather than because he had been in
volved in horrific scenes of Dark 
Magic. ÒYouÕd think people had better things to gossip about,Ó said 
Ginny, as she sat on the common
 room floor, leaning against 
HarryÕs legs and reading the 
Daily Prophet.
 ÒThree dementor at-
tacks in a week, and all Romilda Va
ne does is ask me if itÕs true 
youÕve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.Ó 
Ron and Hermione both roared 
with laughter. Harry ignored 
them. 
 &"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 015" ÒWhat did you tell her?Ó 
ÒI told her itÕs a Hungarian Ho
rntail,Ó said Ginny, turning a 
page of the newspaper id
ly. ÒMuch more macho.Ó 
ÒThanks,Ó said Harry, grinning
. ÒAnd what did you tell her 
RonÕs got?Ó 
ÒA Pygmy Puff, but I 
didnÕt say where.Ó 
Ron scowled as Hermione 
rolled around laughing. 
ÒWatch it,Ó he said, pointing
 warningly at Harry and Ginny. 
ÒJust because IÕve given my permission doesnÕt mean I canÕt with-
draw it ÑÓ 
ÒÔYour permission,
ÕÓ scoffed Ginny. ÒSince when did you give me 
permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself youÕd rather 
it was Harry than Michael or Dean.Ó 
ÒYeah, I would,Ó said Ron grudging
ly. ÒAnd just as long as you 
donÕt start snogging each other in public ÑÓ 
ÒYou filthy hypocrite! What ab
out you and Lavender, thrashing 
around like a pair of eels all 
over the place?Ó demanded Ginny. 
But RonÕs tolerance was not to be
 tested much as they moved 
into June, for Harry and GinnyÕs time together was becoming in-
creasingly restricted. GinnyÕs O.
W.L.s were approaching and she 
was therefore forced to study for ho
urs into the night. On one such 
evening, when Ginny had retired to the library, and Harry was sit-
ting beside the window in the 
common room, supposedly finishing 
his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly 
happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-
time, Hermione dropped into the 
seat between him and Ron with 
an unpleasantly purpos
eful look on her face. 
ÒI want to talk to you, Harry.Ó 
ÒWhat about?Ó said Harry suspicio
usly. Only the previous day, 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 016" Hermione had told him off for 
distracting Ginny when she ought 
to be working hard for her examinations. 
ÒThe so-called Half-Blood Prince.Ó 
ÒOh, not again,Ó he groaned. ÒWill you please drop it?Ó 
He had not dared to return to 
the Room of Requirement to re-
trieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffering ac-
cordingly (though Slughorn, who a
pproved of Ginny, had jocularly 
attributed this to Harry being lo
vesick). But Harry was sure that 
Snape had not yet given up hope of
 laying hands on the PrinceÕs 
book, and was determined to leave 
it where it was while Snape re-
mained on the lookout. 
ÒIÕm not dropping it,Ó said Herm
ione firmly, Òuntil youÕve heard 
me out. Now, IÕve been trying to find out a bit about who might 
make a hobby of invent
ing Dark spells ÑÓ 
ÒHe didnÕt make a hobby of it ÑÓ 
ÒHe, he Ñ who says itÕs a he?Ó 
ÒWeÕve been through this
,Ó said Harry crossly. Ò
Prince, Hermi-
one, Prince!Ó ÒRight!Ó said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she 
pulled a very old piece of newsprint
 out of her pocket and slammed 
it down on the table in front of 
Harry. ÒLook at that! Look at the 
picture!Ó Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the 
moving photograph, yellowed with ag
e; Ron leaned over for a look 
too. The picture showed a skinny gi
rl of around fifteen. She was not 
pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy 
brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the photograph was the 
caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones 
Team. !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 017" ÒSo?Ó said Harry, scanning the sh
ort news item to which the pic-
ture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool compe-
titions. 
ÒHer name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince, Harry.Ó 
They looked at each other, an
d Harry realized what Hermione 
was trying to say. He
 burst out laughing. 
ÒNo way.Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó 
ÒYou think 
she was the Half-Blood . 
. . ? Oh, come on.Ó 
ÒWell, why not? Harry, there arenÕ
t any real princes in the Wiz-
arding world! ItÕs either a nickname, a made-up title somebodyÕs 
given themselves, or it could be th
eir actual name, couldnÕt it? No, 
listen! If, say, her father was a 
wizard whose surname was Prince, 
and her mother was a Muggle, th
en that would make her a Ôhalf-
blood PrinceÕ!Ó 
ÒYeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .Ó 
ÒBut it would! Maybe she was pr
oud of being ha
lf a Prince!Ó 
ÒListen, Hermione, I can tell itÕs
 not a girl. I can just tell.Ó 
ÒThe truth is that you donÕt think a girl would have been clever 
enough,Ó said Hermione angrily. 
ÒHow can I have hung round wi
th you for five years and not 
think girls are clever?Ó said Harry
, stung by this. ÒItÕs the way he 
writes, I just know the Prince was a 
bloke, I can tell. This girl hasnÕt 
got anything to do with it. Wh
ere did you get this anyway?Ó 
ÒThe library,Ó said Hermione pred
ictably. ÒThereÕs a whole col-
lection of old 
Prophets
 up there. Well, IÕm going to find out more 
about Eileen Prin
ce if I can.Ó 
ÒEnjoy yourself,Ó sa
id Harry irritably. 
ÒI will,Ó said Hermione. ÒAnd the 
first place IÕll look,Ó she shot 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 018" at him, as she reached the portrait
 hole, Òis records of old Potions 
awards!Ó 
Harry scowled after her for a mo
ment, then continued his con-
templation of th
e darkening sky. 
ÒSheÕs just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,Ó 
said Ron, returning to his copy of 
A Thousand Magical Herbs and 
Fungi. ÒYou donÕt think IÕm mad, want
ing that book back, do you?Ó 
ÒÕCourse not,Ó said Ron robustly
. ÒHe was a genius, the Prince. 
Anyway . . . without his bezoar tip 
. . .Ó He drew his finger signifi-
cantly across his own throat. ÒI wo
uldnÕt be here to discuss it, 
would I? I mean, IÕm not saying th
at spell you used on Malfoy was 
great ÑÓ 
ÒNor am I,Ó said Harry quickly. 
ÒBut he healed all right, didnÕt he? Back on his feet in no time.Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Harry; this was pe
rfectly true, although his con-
science squirmed slight
ly all the same. ÒTha
nks to Snape . . .Ó 
ÒYou still got detention with Snape this Saturday?Ó Ron con-
tinued. 
ÒYeah, and the Saturday after that
, and the Saturday after that,Ó 
sighed Harry. ÒAnd heÕs hinting no
w that if I donÕt get all the boxes 
done by the end of 
term, weÕll carry on next year.Ó 
He was finding these detentions
 particularly irksome because 
they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending 
with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether 
Snape did not know this, for he 
was keeping Harry later and later 
every time, while making pointed 
asides about Harry having to 
miss the good weather and the vari
ed opportunities it offered. 
Harry was shaken from these bitter 
reflections by the appearance

y Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of 
parchment. 
ÒThanks, Jimmy . . . Hey, itÕs
 from Dumbledore!Ó said Harry 
excitedly, unrolling the parchmen
t and scanning it
. ÒHe wants me 
to go to his office as quick as I can!Ó 
They stared at each other. 
ÒBlimey,Ó whispered Ron. ÒYou 
donÕt reckon . . . he hasnÕt 
found . . . ?Ó 
ÒBetter go and see, hadnÕt I?Ó sa
id Harry, jumping to his feet. 
He hurried out of 
the common room an
d along the seventh 
floor as fast as he could, passi
ng nobody but Peeves, who swooped 
past in the opposite direction, th
rowing bits of ch
alk at Harry in a 
routine sort of way and cackling
 loudly as he dodged HarryÕs de-
fensive jinx. Once Peeves had vani
shed, there was silence in the 
corridors; with only fifteen minute
s left until curfew, most people 
had already returned to
 their common rooms. 
And then Harry heard a scream an
d a crash. He stopped in his 
tracks, listening. 
ÒHow Ñ 
dare Ñ you Ñ aaaaargh!Ó 
The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted 
toward it, his wand at the ready,
 hurtled around another corner, 
and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head 
covered in one of her many shawls
, several sherry bottles lying be-
side her, one broken. 
ÒProfessor ÑÓ 
Harry hurried forward and helped
 Professor Trelawney to her 
feet. Some of her glittering bead
s had become entangled with her 
glasses. She hiccuped loudly, patted
 her hair, and pulled herself up 
on HarryÕs helping arm. 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"

ÒYou may well ask!Ó she said shrilly
. ÒI was strolling along, brood-
ing upon certain dark portents I 
happen to have 
glimpsed . . .Ó

dancing trolls, and on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch 
of stone wall th

ÒProfessor, were you trying to

ÒThe Room of Requirement,Ó repeated Harry. ÒWere you trying 
to get in there?Ó 
ÒI Ñ well Ñ I didnÕt know students knew about ÑÓ 
ÒNot all of them do,Ó said 
Harry. ÒBut what happened? You 
screamed. . . . It sounded as 
though you were hurt. . . .Ó 
ÒI Ñ well,Ó said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around 
her defensively and staring down at
 him with her vastly magnified 
eyes. ÒI wished to Ñ ah Ñ deposi

d something about Ònasty accusa-

ÒRight,Ó said Harry, glancing dow
n at the sherry bottles. ÒBut 
you couldnÕt get in and hide them?Ó 
He found this very odd; the room
 had opened for him, after all, 
when he had wanted to hide 
the Half-Blood Pr
inceÕs book. 
ÒOh, I got in all right,Ó said Pr
ofessor Trelawney, glaring at the 
wall. ÒBut there was some

ÒA voice? Saying what?Ó 
ÒI donÕt know that it was sa
ying anything,Ó said Professor 
Trelawney. ÒIt was . . . whooping.Ó 
ÒWhooping
?Ó ÒGleefully,Ó she said, nodding. 
Harry stared at her. 
ÒWas it male or female?Ó 
ÒI would hazard a guess at male
,Ó said Professor Trelawney. 
ÒAnd it sounded happy?Ó 
ÒVery happy,Ó said Profes
sor Trelawney sniffily. 
ÒAs though it was celebrating?Ó 
ÒMost definitely.Ó 
ÒAnd then Ñ ?Ó 
ÒAnd then I called out ÔWhoÕs there?ÕÓ 
ÒYou couldnÕt have found out who it was without asking?Ó Harry 
asked her, slightly frustrated. 
ÒThe Inner Eye,Ó said Professor Tr
elawney with dignity, straight-
ening her shawls and many strands 
of glittering beads, Òwas fixed 
upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping 
voices.Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry hastily; 
he had heard ab
out Professor 
TrelawneyÕs Inner Eye all too oft
en before. ÒAnd did the voice say 
who was there?Ó 
ÒNo, it did not,Ó she said. ÒEverything went pitch-black and the 
next thing I knew, I was being hurl
ed headfirst out 
of the room!Ó 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 091" ÒAnd you didnÕt see that coming?Ó said Harry, unable to help 
himself. 
ÒNo, I did not, as I say, it wa
s pitch ÑÓ She stopped and glared 
at him suspiciously. 
ÒI think youÕd better tell Profe
ssor Dumbledore,Ó said Harry. 
ÒHe ought to know MalfoyÕs celebrating Ñ I mean, that someone 
threw you out of the room.Ó 
To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this sug-
gestion, looking haughty. 
ÒThe headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits 
from me,Ó she said coldly. ÒI 
am not one to press my company 
upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore 
the warnings the cards show ÑÓ 
Her bony hand closed suddenly 
around HarryÕs wrist. ÒAgain and 
again, no matter how I lay them 
out ÑÓ And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her 
shawls. ÒÑ the lightning-struck to
wer,Ó she whispered. ÒCalamity. 
Disaster. Coming nearer
 all the time . . .Ó 
ÒRight,Ó said Harry again. ÒWell . 
. . I still think you should tell 
Dumbledore about this voice, and 
everything going dark and being 
thrown out of the room. . . .Ó 
ÒYou think so?Ó Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the 
matter for a moment, but Harry coul
d tell that she liked the idea 
of retelling her 
little adventure. 
ÒIÕm going to see him 
right now,Ó said Harry.
 ÒIÕve got a meeting 
with him. We coul
d go together.Ó 
ÒOh, well, in that case,Ó said 
Professor Trelawney with a smile. 
She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles, and dumped them 
unceremoniously in a large blue-and-white vase standing in a 
nearby niche. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 099" ÒI miss having you in my classe
s, Harry,Ó she said soulfully as 
they set off together. ÒYou were never much of a Seer . . . but you 
were a wonderful Object . . .Ó 
Harry did not reply; he had loathe
d being the Object of Profes-
sor TrelawneyÕs continua
l predictions of doom. 
ÒI am afraid,Ó she went on, Òt
hat the nag Ñ IÕm sorry, the cen-
taur Ñ knows nothing of cartoman
cy. I asked him Ñ one Seer to 
another Ñ had he not, too, sensed
 the distant vibrations of com-
ing catastrophe? But he seemed to
 find me almost comical. Yes, 
comical!Ó 
Her voice rose rather hysterical
ly, and Harry caught a powerful 
whiff of sherry even though the 
bottles had been
 left behind. 
ÒPerhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited 
my great-great-grandm
otherÕs gift. Those 
rumors have been 
bandied about by the jealous for year
s. You know what I say to such 
people, Harry? Would Dumbledore ha
ve let me teach at this great 
school, put so much trust in me 
all these years, had I not proved 
myself to him?Ó 
Harry mumbled something indistinct. 
ÒI well remember my first in
terview with Dumbledore,Ó went 
on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. ÒHe was deeply im-
pressed, of course, deeply impresse
d. . . . I was staying at the HogÕs 
Head, which I do not advise, incid
entally Ñ bedbugs, dear boy Ñ 
but funds were low. Dumbledore di
d me the courtesy of calling 
upon me in my room. He questio
ned me. . . . I must confess that, 
at first, I thought he seemed ill-
disposed toward Divination . . . 
and I remember I was starting to 
feel a little odd, I had not eaten 
much that day . . 
. but then . . .Ó 
And now Harry was paying attentio
n properly for the first time, 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 090" for he knew what had happened 
then: Professor Trelawney had 
made the prophecy that had altered 
the course of his whole life, the 
prophecy about him and Voldemort. 
Ò. . . but then we were rudely
 interrupted by Severus Snape!Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó 
ÒYes, there was a commotion outs
ide the door and it flew open, 
and there was that rather uncout
h barman standing with Snape, 
who was waffling about having come
 the wrong way up the stairs, 
although IÕm afraid that I myself
 rather thought he had been ap-
prehended eavesdropping on my
 interview with Dumbledore Ñ 
you see, he himself was seeking 
a job at the time, and no doubt 
hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore 
seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help 
thinking, Harry, that it
 was because he appreciated the stark con-
trast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, com-
pared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to 
listen at keyholes Ñ Harry, dear?Ó 
She looked back over her shoulder, 
having only just realized that 
Harry was no longer with her; he
 had stopped walking and they 
were now ten feet 
from each other. 
ÒHarry?Ó she repeat
ed uncertainly. 
Perhaps his face was white to ma
ke her look so concerned and 
frightened. Harry was standing st
ock-still as waves of shock 
crashed over him, wave after wave
, obliterating everything except 
the information that had been ke
pt from him for so long. . . . 
It was Snape who had overheard 
the prophecy. It was Snape who 
had carried the news of the prop
hecy to Voldemort. Snape and 
Peter Pettigrew together had sent 
Voldemort hunting after Lily and 
James and their son. . . . 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 095" Nothing else mattered 
to Harry just now. 
ÒHarry?Ó said Professor Trelaw
ney again. ÒHarry Ñ I thought 
we were going to see the headmaster together?Ó 
ÒYou stay here,Ó said 
Harry through numb lips. 
ÒBut dear . . . I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the 
Room of ÑÓ 
ÒYou stay here!Ó Harr
y repeated angrily. 
She looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the corner into 
DumbledoreÕs corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. 
Harry shouted the password at the 
gargoyle and ran up the moving 
spiral staircase three steps at a 
time. He did not knock upon Dum-
bledoreÕs door, he hammered; an
d the calm voice answered, ÒEn-
terÓ after Harry had already 
flung himself into the room. 
Fawkes the phoenix looked around
, his bright black eyes gleam-
ing with reflected gold from th
e sunset beyond the windows. 
Dumbledore was standing at th
e window looking out at the 
grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in his arms. 
ÒWell, Harry, I promised that
 you could come with me.Ó 
For a moment or two, Harry di
d not understand; the conversa-
tion with Trelawney had driven eve
rything else out of his head and 
his brain seemed to be
 moving very slowly. 
ÒCome . . . with you . . . ?Ó 
ÒOnly if you wish it, of course.Ó 
ÒIf I . . .Ó 
And then Harry remember
ed why he had been 
eager to come to 
DumbledoreÕs office in the first pl
ace. ÒYouÕve found one? YouÕve 
found a Horcrux?Ó 
ÒI believe so.Ó 
 &#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 096" Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: For several 
moments, Harry could not speak. 
ÒIt is natural to be afraid,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒIÕm not scared!Ó said Harry at 
once, and it was perfectly true; 
fear was one emotion he was not feel
ing at all. ÒWhich Horcrux is 
it? Where is it?Ó 
ÒI am not sure which it is Ñ though I think we can rule out the 
snake Ñ but I believe it to be hi
dden in a cave on the coast many 
miles from here, a cave I have been
 trying to locate for a very long 
time: the cave in which Tom Riddl
e once terrorized two children 
from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry. ÒHow is it protected?Ó 
ÒI do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.Ó 
Dumbledore hesitated, then said, ÒH
arry, I promised you that you 
could come with me, and I stand by
 that promise, but it would be 
very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly 
dangerous.Ó ÒIÕm coming,Ó said Harry, almo
st before Dumbledore had fin-
ished speaking. Boiling with anger 
at Snape, his desire to do some-
thing desperate and risky had incr
eased tenfold in the last few 
minutes. This seemed to show on HarryÕs face, for Dumbledore 
moved away from the window and 
looked more closely at Harry, a 
slight crease between 
his silver eyebrows. 
ÒWhat has happened to you?Ó 
ÒNothing,Ó lied Harry promptly. 
ÒWhat has upset you?Ó 
ÒIÕm not upset.Ó 
ÒHarry, you were never 
a good Occlumens ÑÓ 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 097" The word was the spark th
at ignited HarryÕs fury. 
ÒSnape!Ó he said, very loudly, and 
Fawkes gave a soft squawk be-
hind them. ÒSnapeÕs whatÕs happ
ened! He told Voldemort about 
the prophecy, it was 
him, he listened outsid
e the door, Trelawney 
told me!Ó 
DumbledoreÕs expression did no
t change, but Ha
rry thought his 
face whitened under the bloody tinge 
cast by the setting sun. For a 
long moment, Dumbledore said no
thing. ÒWhen did you find out 
about this?Ó he 
asked at last. 
ÒJust now!Ó said Harry, who was 
refraining from yelling with 
enormous difficulty. And then, su
ddenly, he coul
d not stop him-
self. ÒAND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD 
VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!Ó 
Breathing hard as though he 
was fighting, Harry turned away 
from Dumbledore, who still had 
not moved a muscle, and paced 
up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exer-
cising every last bit of restraint 
to prevent himself knocking things 
over. He wanted to rage and st
orm at Dumbledore,
 but he also 
wanted to go with him to try an
d destroy the Horcrux; he wanted 
to tell him that he was a foolish ol
d man for trusting Snape, but he 
was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he 
mastered his anger. . . . 
ÒHarry,Ó said Dumbledore quietly. ÒPlease listen to me.Ó 
It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from 
shouting. Harry paused, biting his 
lip, and looked into Dumble-
doreÕs lined face. 
ÒProfessor Snape made a terrible ÑÓ 
ÒDonÕt tell me it was a mistake, 
sir, he was listen
ing at the door!Ó 
ÒPlease let me finish.Ó Dumb
ledore waited until Harry had 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 098" nodded curtly, then went on. ÒProfessor Snape made a terrible mis-
take. He was still in Lord Voldemor
tÕs employ on the night he heard 
the first half of Professor TrelawneyÕ
s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened 
to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most 
deeply. But he did no
t know Ñ he had no 
possible way of know-
ing Ñ which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that 
the parents he would destroy in his 
murderous quest were people that 
Professor Snape knew, that they we
re your mother and father ÑÓ 
Harry let out a yell of
 mirthless laughter. 
ÒHe hated my dad like he hate
d Sirius! HavenÕt you noticed, 
Professor, how the people Snape 
hates tend to end up dead?Ó 
ÒYou have no idea of the remo
rse Professor Snape felt when he 
realized how Lord Voldemort had 
interpreted the prophecy, Harry. 
I believe it to be the greatest regret
 of his life and th
e reason that he 
returned ÑÓ 
ÒBut heÕs
 a very good Occlumens, isnÕt 
he, sir?Ó said Harry, whose 
voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. ÒAnd isnÕt 
Voldemort convinced that SnapeÕs on
 his side, even now? Professor 
. . . how can you be 
sure SnapeÕs on our side?Ó 
Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though 
he was trying to make up his mi
nd about something. At last he 
said, ÒI am sure. I trust 
Severus Snape 
completely.Ó 
Harry breathed deeply for a few 
moments in an effort to steady 
himself. It did not work. 
ÒWell, I donÕt!Ó he said, as loudly as before. ÒHeÕs up to some-
thing with Draco Malfoy right now,
 right under your nose, and you 
still ÑÓ 
ÒWe have discussed this, Harry,Ó said Dumbledore, and now he 
sounded stern again. ÒI ha
ve told you my views.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 00:" ÒYouÕre leaving the school tonight, and IÕll bet you havenÕt even 
considered that Snape and Ma
lfoy might decide to ÑÓ 
ÒTo what?Ó asked Dumbledore, his 
eyebrows raised. ÒWhat is it 
that you suspect them of doing, precisely?Ó 
ÒI . . . theyÕre up to something!
Ó said Harry, and his hands curled 
into fists as he said it. ÒProfessor 
Trelawney was just in the Room of 
Requirement, trying to hide her 
sherry bottles, and she heard Mal-
foy whooping, celebrating! HeÕs trying to mend something danger-
ous in there and if you ask me, heÕs fixed it at last and youÕre about 
to just walk out of 
school without ÑÓ 
ÒEnough,Ó said Dumbledore. He 
said it quite calmly, and yet 
Harry fell silent at once; he knew 
that he had finally crossed some 
invisible line. ÒDo you think that 
I have once left
 the school un-
protected during my absences this 
year? I have not. Tonight, when 
I leave, there will again 
be additional protection
 in place. Please do 
not suggest that I do not take the 
safety of my students seriously, 
Harry.Ó 
ÒI didnÕt ÑÓ mumbled Harry, a 
little abashed, but Dumbledore 
cut across him. 
ÒI do not wish to discuss the matter any further.Ó 
Harry bit back his retort, scared th
at he had gone too far, that he 
had ruined his chance of acco
mpanying Dumbledore, but Dum-
bledore went on, ÒDo you wish to come with me tonight?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry at once. 
ÒVery well, then: Listen.Ó Dumb
ledore drew himself up to his 
full height. ÒI take you with me 
on one condition: that you obey 
any command I might gi
ve you at once, and 
without question.Ó 
ÒOf course.Ó 
ÒBe sure to understand me, Harry.
 I mean that you must follow 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 00;" even such orders as Ôrun,Õ Ôhide,
Õ or Ôgo back.Õ Do I have your 
word?Ó 
ÒI Ñ yes, of course.Ó 
ÒIf I tell you to hide, you will do so?Ó 
ÒYes.Ó 
ÒIf I tell you to flee, you will obey?Ó 
ÒYes.Ó 
ÒIf I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell 
you? ÒI ÑÓ 
ÒHarry?Ó They looked at each
 other for a moment. 
ÒYes, sir.Ó 
ÒVery good. Then I wish you to go
 and fetch your Invisibility 
Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutesÕ time.Ó 
Dumbledore turned back to look
 out of the fiery window; the 
sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon. Harry walked 
quickly from the office and down th
e spiral staircase. His mind was 
oddly clear all of a sudden
. He knew what to do. 
Ron and Hermione were sitting 
together in the common room 
when he came back. ÒWhat does he 
want?Ó Hermione said at once. 
ÒHarry, are you okay?Ó 
she added anxiously. 
ÒIÕm fine,Ó said Harry shortly, ra
cing past them. He dashed up 
the stairs and into his dormitory
, where he flung open his trunk 
and pulled out the MarauderÕs Map 
and a pair of balled-up socks. 
Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, 
skidding to a halt where Ron and 
Hermione sat, looking stunned. 
ÒIÕve got to be quick,Ó Harry 
panted. ÒDumbledore thinks IÕm 
getting my Invisibility 
Cloak. Listen. . . .Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 00<" Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not 
pause either for HermioneÕs gasps of horror or for RonÕs hasty ques-
tions; they could work out the fi
ner details for th
emselves later. 
Ò. . . so you see what this means?Ó Harry finished at a gallop. 
ÒDumbledore wonÕt be here tonight,
 so MalfoyÕs going to have an-
other clear shot at wh
atever heÕs up to. 
No, listen to me
!Ó he hissed 
angrily, as both Ron and Hermione
 showed every sign of interrupt-
ing. ÒI know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Require-
ment. Here ÑÓ He shoved the Ma
rauderÕs Map into HermioneÕs 
hands. ÒYouÕve got to watch him an
d youÕve got to watch Snape too. 
Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D.A., Hermione, 
those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says heÕs 
put extra protection in the school
, but if SnapeÕs involved, heÕll 
know what DumbledoreÕs protection
 is, and how to avoid it Ñ but 
he wonÕt be expecting you lot to
 be on the watch, will he?Ó 
ÒHarry ÑÓ began He
rmione, her eyes huge with fear. 
ÒI havenÕt got time to
 argue,Ó said Harry cu
rtly. ÒTake this as 
well ÑÓ He thrust the socks into RonÕs hands. 
ÒThanks,Ó said Ron. ÒEr Ñ why do I need socks?Ó 
ÒYou need whatÕs wrapped in them, 
itÕs the Felix Felicis. Share it 
between yourselves and Ginny too. Say good-bye to her for me. IÕd 
better go, DumbledoreÕs waiting ÑÓ 
ÒNo!Ó said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of 
golden potion, looking awestruck. 
ÒWe donÕt want it, you take it, 
who knows what youÕre 
going to be facing?Ó 
ÒIÕll be fine, IÕll be with Dumb
ledore,Ó said Harry. ÒI want to 
know you lot are okay. . . . DonÕt look like that, Hermione, IÕll see 
you later. . . .Ó 
&#'""2''(""3/'(#'$(4"
 001" And he was off, hurrying back th
rough the portrait hole and to-
ward the entrance hall. 
Dumbledore was waiting beside
 the oaken front doors. He 
turned as Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step, 
panting hard, a searing 
stitch in his side. 
ÒI would like you to wear your cloak, please,Ó said Dumbledore, 
and he waited until Harry had thro
wn it on before saying, ÒVery 
good. Shall we go?Ó 
Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own trav-
eling cloak barely stirring in th
e still summer air. Harry hurried 
alongside him under the Invisibility
 Cloak, still panting and sweat-
ing rather a lot. 
ÒBut what will people think when
 they see you leaving, Profes-
sor?Ó Harry asked, his mind
 on Malfoy and Snape. 
ÒThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,Ó said Dumbledore 
lightly. ÒI sometimes offer Rosmer
ta my custom, or else visit the 
HogÕs Head . . . or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of dis-
guising oneÕs true destination.Ó 
They made their way down the dr
ive in the gathering twilight. 
The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water, and wood 
smoke from HagridÕs cabin. It was difficult to believe that they 
were heading for anything dangerous or frightening. 
ÒProfessor,Ó said Harry quietly, as 
the gates at the bottom of the 
drive came into view, Òwill we be Apparating?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒYou can Apparate now, I believe?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry, Òbut 
I havenÕt got a license.Ó 
He felt it best to be honest; wh
at if he spoiled everything by 
turning up a hundred miles from
 where he was supposed to go? 
ÒNo matter,Ó said Dumbledore
, ÒI can assist you again.Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./'"
 009" They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to 
Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast
 as they walked, and by the 
time they reached the High Street
 night was falling in earnest. 
Lights twinkled from windows ov
er shops and as they neared the 
Three Broomsticks they 
heard raucous shouting. 
ÒÑ and stay out!Ó shouted Madam 
Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a 
grubby-looking wizard. ÒO
h, hello, Albus . . . Yo
uÕre out late . . .Ó 
ÒGood evening, Rosmerta, good evening . . . forgive me, IÕm off 
to the HogÕs Head. . . . No offense,
 but I feel like a quieter atmo-
sphere tonight. . . .Ó 
A minute later they turned the co
rner into the side street where 
the HogÕs HeadÕs sign creaked a li
ttle, though there was no breeze. 
In contrast to the Three Broomstic
ks, the pub appeared to be com-
pletely empty. 
ÒIt will not be necessary for us 
to enter,Ó muttered Dumbledore, 
glancing around. ÒAs long as nobody
 sees us go . . . now place your 
hand upon my arm, Harry. There is 
no need to grip too hard, I am 
merely guiding you. On the count of three . . . One . . . two . . . 
three . . .Ó 
Harry turned. At once, there was th
at horrible sensation that he 
was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw 
breath, every part of him was be
ing compressed almost past en-
durance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the in-
visible bands seemed to burst open,
 and he was stan
ding in cool 
darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air. 
!"#"$"%"&"'"(""&")"'"*"&"+","-"."/"
""000" &#'"!$1'"
   arry could smell salt and hear
 rushing waves; a light, 
chilly breeze ruffled his hair
 as he looked out at moon-
lit sea and star-strewn sky. He wa
s standing upon a high outcrop of 
dark rock, water foaming and ch
urning below him. He glanced 
over his shoulder. A towering cli
ff stood behind them, a sheer drop, 
black and faceless. A few large ch
unks of rock, such as the one 
upon which Harry and Dumbledore 
were standing, looked as 
though they had broken away from 
the cliff face at
 some point in 
the past. It was a bleak, harsh view
, the sea and the rock unrelieved 
by any tree or swee
p of grass or sand. 
ÒWhat do you think?Ó asked Dumbledore. He might have been 
asking HarryÕs opinion on whether 
it was a good si
te for a picnic. 
ÒThey brought the kids from th
e orphanage here?Ó asked Harry, 
who could not imagine a less 
cozy spot for a day trip. 
ÒNot here, precisely,Ó said Dumb
ledore. ÒThere is
 a village of 
sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans 
#"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 002" were taken there for a little sea ai
r and a view of the waves. No, I 
think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who 
visited this spot. No Muggle could 
reach this rock unless they were 
uncommonly good mountaineers, an
d boats cannot approach the 
cliffs, the waters around them ar
e too dangerous. I imagine that 
Riddle climbed down; magic would ha
ve served better than ropes. 
And he brought two small childr
en with him, probably for the 
pleasure of terrorizing them. I t
hink the journey alone would have 
done it, donÕt you?Ó 
Harry looked up at the cliff 
again and felt goose bumps. 
ÒBut his final destination Ñ and ou
rs Ñ lies a little farther on. 
Come.Ó 
Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the 
very edge of the rock where 
a series of jagged niches made f
ootholds leading down to boulders 
that lay half-submerged in water an
d closer to the cliff. It was a 
treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his 
withered hand, moved slowly. The 
lower rocks were slippery with 
seawater. Harry could feel flecks of
 cold salt spray 
hitting his face. 
ÒLumos,Ó said Dumbledore, as he re
ached the boulder closest to 
the cliff face. A thousand flecks 
of golden light sparkled upon the 
dark surface of the water a few fe
et below where he crouched; the 
black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. 
ÒYou see?Ó said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little 
higher. Harry saw a fissure in the 
cliff into which dark water was 
swirling. ÒYou will not object to
 getting a little wet?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry. 
ÒThen take off your In
visibility Cloak Ñ ther
e is no need for it 
now Ñ and let us ta
ke the plunge.Ó 
&#'""!$1'"
 003" And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumble-
dore slid from the boulder, landed
 in the sea, and began to swim, 
with a perfect breaststroke, toward th
e dark slit in the rock face, his 
lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pu
lled off his cloak, stuffed it into 
his pocket, and followed. 
The water was icy; HarryÕs waterl
ogged clothes billowed around 
him and weighed him down. Taking
 deep breaths that filled his 
nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the 
shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. 
The fissure soon opened into a da
rk tunnel that 
Harry could tell 
would be filled with water at high 
tide. The slimy walls were barely 
three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of 
DumbledoreÕs wand. A little way in
, the passageway curved to the 
left, and Harry saw that it
 extended far into th
e cliff. He continued 
to swim in DumbledoreÕs wake, th
e tips of his benumbed fingers 
brushing the ro
ugh, wet rock. 
Then he saw Dumbledore rising ou
t of the water ahead, his sil-
ver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot 
he found steps that led into a la
rge cave. He clambered up them, 
water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering 
uncontrollably, into the 
still and freezing air. 
Dumbledore was standing in the 
middle of the cave, his wand 
held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and 
ceiling. 
ÒYes, this is the plac
e,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒHow can you tell?Ó Ha
rry spoke in a whisper. 
ÒIt has known magic,Ó sa
id Dumbledore simply. 
Harry could not tell wh
ether the shivers he was experiencing 
were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 004" enchantments. He watc
hed as Dumbledore co
ntinued to revolve 
on the spot, evidently concentratin
g on things Harr
y could not see. 
ÒThis is merely the antechamber,
 the entrance hall,Ó said Dum-
bledore after a moment or two. 
ÒWe need to penetrate the inner 
place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldem
ortÕs obstacles that stand in our 
way, rather than thos
e nature made. . . .Ó 
Dumbledore approached the wall of
 the cave and caressed it 
with his blackened fingertips, 
murmuring words in a strange 
tongue that Harry did not unders
tand. Twice Dumbledore walked 
right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he 
could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and for-
ward over a particular spot, unti
l finally he stopped, his hand 
pressed flat against the wall. 
ÒHere,Ó he said. ÒWe go on thro
ugh here. The entrance is con-
cealed.Ó 
Harry did not ask how Dumbledore
 knew. He had never seen a 
wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; 
but Harry had long since learned 
that bangs and smoke were more 
often the marks of
 ineptitude than expertise. 
Dumbledore stepped back from th
e cave wall and pointed his 
wand at the rock. For a moment, an
 arched outline appeared there, 
blazing white as though there 
was a powerful 
light behind the 
crack. 
ÒYouÕve d-done it!Ó said Harry th
rough chattering teeth, but be-
fore the words had left his lips 
the outline had go
ne, leaving the 
rock as bare and solid as ev
er. Dumbledore looked around. 
ÒHarry, IÕm so sorry, I forgot,Ó he said; he now pointed his wand 
at Harry and at once, HarryÕs clothes were as warm and dry as if 
they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. 
&#'""!$1'"
 005" ÒThank you,Ó said Harry grat
efully, but Dumbledore had al-
ready turned his attention back to
 the solid cave wall. He did not 
try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as 
though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry 
stayed quite still; he did not wa
nt to break DumbledoreÕs concen-
tration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, 
ÒOh, surely not. So crude.Ó 
ÒWhat is it, Professor?Ó 
ÒI rather think,Ó said Dumbledor
e, putting his uninjured hand 
inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind 
Harry used to chop potion ingredients, Òthat we are required to 
make payment to pass.Ó 
ÒPayment?Ó said Harry. ÒYouÕve go
t to give the door something?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledor
e. ÒBlood, if I am 
not much mistaken.Ó 
ÒBlood
?Ó ÒI said it was crude,Ó said Du
mbledore, who sounded disdainful, 
even disappointed, as though Vo
ldemort had fallen short of the 
standards Dumbledore expected. ÒThe idea, as I am sure you will 
have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to 
enter. Once again, Lord Voldemor
t fails to grasp that there are 
much more terrible things
 than physical injury.Ó 
ÒYeah, but still, if you can avoid 
it . . .Ó said Harry, who had ex-
perienced enough pain no
t to be keen for more. 
ÒSometimes, however, it is unavoidable,Ó said Dumbledore, 
shaking back the sleeve 
of his robes and exposi
ng the forearm of his 
injured hand. 
ÒProfessor!Ó protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore 
raised his knife. ÒIÕll do it, IÕm ÑÓ 
He did not know what he was going to say Ñ younger, fitter? 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 026" But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a 
spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening 
drops. ÒYou are very kind, Harry,Ó said
 Dumbledore, now passing the 
tip of his wand over the deep cut 
he had made in his own arm, so 
that it healed instantly, just as
 Snape had healed MalfoyÕs wounds. 
ÒBut your blood is worth more than
 mine. Ah, that seems to have 
done the trick, doesnÕt it?Ó 
The blazing silver outline of an 
arch had appeared in the wall 
once more, and this time it did 
not fade away: The blood-spattered 
rock within it simply vanished
, leaving an opening into what 
seemed total darkness. 
ÒAfter me, I think,Ó said Dumb
ledore, and he walked through 
the archway with Harry 
on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily 
as he went. 
An eerie sight met their eyes: They
 were standing on the edge of 
a great black lake, so vast that
 Harry could not make out the dis-
tant banks, in a cavern so high that
 the ceiling too was out of sight. 
A misty greenish light shone far aw
ay in what looked like the mid-
dle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. 
The greenish glow and the light fr
om the two wands were the only 
things that broke the otherwise velv
ety blackness, th
ough their rays 
did not penetrate as fa
r as Harry would have expected. The dark-
ness was somehow denser than normal darkness. 
ÒLet us walk,Ó said Dumbledore 
quietly. ÒBe very careful not to 
step into the water. Stay close to me.Ó 
He set off around the edge of 
the lake, and Harry followed close 
behind him. Their footsteps made ec
hoing, slapping sounds on the 
narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they 
&#'""!$1'"
 027" walked, but the view did not vary: 
on one side of them, the rough 
cavern wall, on the other, the bo
undless expanse of smooth, glassy 
blackness, in the very middle of w
hich was that mysterious greenish 
glow. Harry found the pl
ace and the silence oppressive, unnerving. 
ÒProfessor?Ó he said finally. ÒDo 
you think the Horcrux is here?Ó 
ÒOh yes,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒYes, IÕm sure it is. The question is, 
how do we get to it?Ó 
ÒWe couldnÕt . . . we couldnÕt
 just try a Summoning Charm?Ó 
Harry said, sure that it was a stup
id suggestion. But he was much 
keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place 
as soon as possible. 
ÒCertainly we could,Ó said Du
mbledore, stopping so suddenly 
that Harry almo
st walked into him. ÒWhy donÕt you do it?Ó 
ÒMe? Oh . . . okay . . .Ó Harry had not expected this, but 
cleared his throat and said 
loudly, wand aloft, Ò
Accio Horcrux
!Ó With a noise like an explosion,
 something very large and pale 
erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry 
could see what it was, it had vani
shed again with a crashing splash 
that made great, deep ripples on
 the mirrored surface. Harry leapt 
backward in shock and hit the wall; 
his heart was still thundering as 
he turned to Dumbledore. 
ÒWhat was that?Ó 
ÒSomething, I think, that is read
y to respond should we attempt 
to seize the Horcrux.Ó 
Harry looked back at th
e water. The surface of the lake was once 
more shining black glass: The ri
pples had vanished unnaturally 
fast; HarryÕs hear
t, however, was still pounding. 
ÒDid you think that 
would happen, sir?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 028" ÒI thought 
something would happen if we made an obvious at-
tempt to get our hands on the Ho
rcrux. That was a very good idea, 
Harry; much the simple
st way of finding out 
what we are facing.Ó 
ÒBut we donÕt know what the th
ing was,Ó said Harry, looking at 
the sinisterly smooth water. 
ÒWhat the things 
are, you mean,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI doubt 
very much that there is only on
e of them. Shall 
we walk on?Ó 
ÒProfessor?Ó 
ÒYes, Harry?Ó 
ÒDo you think weÕre going to ha
ve to go into the lake?Ó 
ÒInto it? Only if we 
are very unfortunate.Ó 
ÒYou donÕt think the Horc
rux is at the bottom?Ó 
ÒOh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the 
middle.
Ó And Dumbledore pointed toward 
the misty green light in the 
center of the lake. 
ÒSo weÕre going to have to cr
oss the lake to get to it?Ó 
ÒYes, I think so.Ó 
Harry did not say anything. His th
oughts were all of water mon-
sters, of giant serpents, of demo
ns, kelpies, and sprites. . . . 
ÒAha,Ó said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry 
really did walk into him; for a mo
ment he toppled on the edge of 
the dark water, and DumbledoreÕs 
uninjured hand closed tightly 
around his upper arm, pulling hi
m back. ÒSo sorry, Harry, I should 
have given warning. Stand back ag
ainst the wall, please; I think I 
have found the place.Ó 
Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark 
bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but 
Dumbledore seemed to have detect
ed something special about it. 
This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but 
&#'""!$1'"
 029" through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-
thing invisible. 
ÒOho,Ó said Dumbledore happily, 
seconds later. His hand had 
closed in midair upon somethin
g Harry could not see. Dumble-
dore moved closer to 
the water; Harry watched nervously as the 
tips of DumbledoreÕs buckled shoe
s found the utmost edge of the 
rock rim. Keeping his hand clench
ed in midair, Dumbledore raised 
his wand with the other and tapp
ed his fist with the point. 
Immediately a thick coppery green 
chain appeared out of thin 
air, extending from the depths of the water into DumbledoreÕs 
clenched hand. Dumbledore tapp
ed the chain, which began to 
slide through his fist like a snake, 
coiling itself on the ground with 
a clinking sound that echoed nois
ily off the rocky walls, pulling 
something from the depths of the 
black water. Harry gasped as the 
ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke 
the surface, glowing as green as 
the chain, and floated, with barely
 a ripple, toward the place on the 
bank where Harry an
d Dumbledore stood. 
ÒHow did you know that was th
ere?Ó Harry asked in astonish-
ment. 
ÒMagic always leaves traces,Ó sa
id Dumbledore, as the boat hit 
the bank with a gentle
 bump, Òsometimes very 
distinctive traces. I 
taught Tom Riddle. 
I know his style.Ó 
ÒIs . . . is this boat safe?Ó 
ÒOh yes, I think so. Voldemort 
needed to create a means to 
cross the lake without attracting 
the wrath of those creatures he 
had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his 
Horcrux.Ó 
ÒSo the things in the water wonÕt do anything to us if we cross in 
VoldemortÕs boat?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 02:" ÒI think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at 
some point, realize we are not Lord
 Voldemort. Thus far, however, 
we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.Ó 
ÒBut why have they let us?Ó 
asked Harry, who could not shake 
off the vision of tentacles rising 
out of the dark water the moment 
they were out of 
sight of the bank. 
ÒVoldemort would have
 been reasonably co
nfident that none 
but a very great wizard would have b
een able to find the boat,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒI think he would ha
ve been prepared to risk what 
was, to his mind, the mo
st unlikely possibility
 that somebody else 
would find it, knowing that he ha
d set other obstac
les ahead that 
only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is 
right.Ó Harry looked down into the boat
. It really was very small. 
ÒIt doesnÕt look like it was built 
for two people. Will it hold both 
of us? Will we be 
too heavy together?Ó 
Dumbledore chuckled. 
ÒVoldemort will not have cared 
about the weight, but about the 
amount of magical powe
r that crossed his lake. I rather think an 
enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one 
wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.Ó 
ÒBut then Ñ ?Ó 
ÒI do not think you will count, 
Harry: You are underage and un-
qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old 
to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register 
compared to mine.Ó 
These words did nothing to raise HarryÕs morale; perhaps 
Dumbledore knew it, for he added,
 ÒVoldemortÕs mistake, Harry, 
VoldemortÕs mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it 
&#'""!$1'"
 020" underestimates youth. . . . Now, yo
u first this time, and be careful 
not to touch the water.Ó 
Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the 
boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, 
coiling the chain onto the floor. 
They were crammed in together; 
Harry could not comfortably sit, 
but crouched, his knees jutting over
 the edge of the boat, which be-
gan to move at once. There was no
 sound other than the silken rus-
tle of the boatÕs prow cleaving 
the water; it moved without their 
help, as though an invisible rope 
was pulling it onward toward the 
light in the center. Soon they coul
d no longer see the walls of the 
cavern; they might have been at 
sea except that there were no 
waves. Harry looked down and saw the refl
ected gold of his wandlight 
sparkling and glittering on the blac
k water as they passed. The boat 
was carving deep ripples upon the 
glassy surface, grooves in the 
dark mirror. . . . 
And then Harry saw it, marble whit
e, floating inches below the 
surface. ÒProfessor!Ó he said, and his startl
ed voice echoed loudly over the 
silent water. 
ÒHarry?Ó ÒI think I saw a hand in 
the water Ñ a human hand!Ó 
ÒYes, I am sure you did,Ó 
said Dumbledore calmly. 
Harry stared down into the wate
r, looking for the vanished 
hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. 
ÒSo that thing that jumped
 out of the 
water Ñ ?Ó 
But Harry had his answer before
 Dumbledore could reply; the 
wandlight had slid over a fresh pa
tch of water and showed him, this 
time, a dead man lying faceup inch
es beneath the surface, his open 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 022" eyes misted as though with cobweb
s, his hair and his robes swirling 
around him like smoke. 
ÒThere are bodies in here!Ó said Harry, and his voice sounded 
much higher than usual and most unlike his own. 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore placidly
, Òbut we do not need to worry 
about them at the moment.Ó 
ÒAt the moment?Ó Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the wa-
ter to look at Dumbledore. 
ÒNot while they are merely drif
ting peacefully below us,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒThere is nothing to
 be feared from a body, Harry, 
any more than there is anything 
to be feared from the darkness. 
Lord Voldemort, who of course se
cretly fears both, disagrees. But 
once again he reveals his own lack 
of wisdom. It is the unknown we 
fear when we look 
upon death and darkne
ss, nothing more.Ó 
Harry said nothing; he did not wa
nt to argue, but he found the 
idea that there were bodies floati
ng around them and beneath them 
horrible and, what was more, he di
d not believe that they were not 
dangerous. ÒBut one of them jumped,Ó he sa
id, trying to make his voice as 
level and calm as DumbledoreÕs. ÒWhen I tried to Summon the 
Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI am sure that once we take the 
Horcrux, we shall find them less 
peaceable. However, like many 
creatures that dwell in cold an
d darkness, they fear light and 
warmth, which we shall therefore 
call to our aid should the need 
arise. Fire, Harry,Ó Dumbledore added 
with a smile, in response to 
HarryÕs bewildered expression. 
ÒOh . . . right . . .Ó said Harry 
quickly. He turned his head to 
look at the greenish glow toward w
hich the boat was still inexorably 
&#'""!$1'"
 023" sailing. He could not pretend now 
that he was not scared. The great 
black lake, teeming with
 the dead . . . It seemed hours and hours 
ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron 
and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He
 suddenly wished he had said a 
better good-bye to them 
. . . and he hadnÕt seen
 Ginny at all. . . . 
ÒNearly there,Ó said Dumbledore cheerfully. 
Sure enough, the greenish light s
eemed to be growing larger at 
last, and within minutes, the bo
at had come to a halt, bumping 
gently into something 
that Harry could not see at first, but when 
he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small 
island of smooth rock in
 the center of the lake. 
ÒCareful not to touch the wate
r,Ó said Dumbledore again as 
Harry climbed out of the boat. 
The island was no larger than DumbledoreÕs office, an expanse 
of flat dark stone on which stood 
nothing but the source of that 
greenish light, which looked much
 brighter when viewed close to. 
Harry squinted at it; at
 first, he thought it was a lamp of some 
kind, but then he saw that the ligh
t was coming from a stone basin 
rather like the Pensieve, which 
was set on top of a pedestal. 
Dumbledore approached the basin 
and Harry followed. Side by 
side, they looked down into it. The 
basin was full of an emerald liq-
uid emitting that ph
osphorescent glow. 
ÒWhat is it?Ó aske
d Harry quietly. 
ÒI am not sure,Ó said Dumbledor
e. ÒSomething more worrisome 
than blood and b
odies, however.Ó 
Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve
 of his robe over his black-
ened hand, and stretched out the tips
 of his burned fingers toward 
the surface of the potion. 
ÒSir, no, donÕt touch Ñ !Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 024" ÒI cannot touch,Ó said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. ÒSee? I can-
not approach any nearer than this. You try.Ó 
Staring, Harry put his hand into
 the basin and attempted to 
touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him 
coming within an inch of it. No
 matter how hard he pushed, his 
fingers encountered nothing but wh
at seemed to be solid and in-
flexible air. 
ÒOut of the way, please, Harry,Ó 
said Dumbledore. He raised his 
wand and made complicated move
ments over the surface of the 
potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per-
haps that the potion glowed a litt
le brighter. Harry remained silent 
while Dumbledore worked, but af
ter a while Dumbledore with-
drew his wand, and Harry felt it
 was safe to talk again. 
ÒYou think the Horcrux is in there, sir?Ó 
ÒOh yes.Ó Dumbledore peered mo
re closely into the basin. 
Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of 
the green potion. ÒBut how to reac
h it? This potion cannot be pen-
etrated by hand, Vanished, parted
, scooped up, or siphoned away, 
nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change 
its nature.Ó 
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, 
twirled it once in midair, and then 
caught the crystal goblet that he 
had conjured out of nowhere. ÒI can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.Ó 
ÒWhat?Ó said Harry. ÒNo!Ó 
ÒYes, I think so: Only by drinki
ng it can I empt
y the basin and 
see what lies in its depths.Ó 
ÒBut what if Ñ what
 if it kills you?Ó 
ÒOh, I doubt that it would work
 like that,Ó said Dumbledore 
&#'""!$1'"
 025" easily. ÒLord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who 
reached this island.Ó 
Harry couldnÕt believe it. Was th
is more of DumbledoreÕs insane 
determination to s
ee good in everyone? 
ÒSir,Ó said Harry, trying to keep 
his voice reasonable, Òsir, this is 
Voldemort
 weÕre ÑÓ 
ÒIÕm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to 
im-mediately kill the person who reache
d this island,Ó Dumbledore 
corrected himself. ÒHe would want 
to keep them alive long enough 
to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de-
fenses and, most importantly of all,
 why they were so intent upon 
emptying the basin. Do not forget
 that Lord Voldemort believes 
that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.Ó 
Harry made to speak again, but t
his time Dumbledore raised his 
hand for silence, frowning slightly
 at the emerald liquid, evidently 
thinking hard. 
ÒUndoubtedly,Ó he said, finally, 
Òthis potion must act in a way 
that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, 
cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am dis-
tracted, or render me incapable 
in some other way. This being 
the case, Harry, it will be your jo
b to make sure I keep drinking, 
even if you have to tip the potion
 into my protesting mouth. You 
understand?Ó 
Their eyes met over the basin, each 
pale face lit with that strange, 
green light. Harry did not speak. 
Was this why he had been invited 
along Ñ so that he could forc
e-feed Dumbledore a potion that 
might cause him unendurable pain? 
ÒYou remember,Ó said Dumbledo
re, Òthe condition on which I 
brought you with me?Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 036" Harry hesitated, looking into th
e blue eyes that had turned 
green in the reflected 
light of the basin. 
ÒBut what if Ñ ?Ó 
ÒYou swore, did you not, to 
follow any command I gave you?Ó 
ÒYes, but ÑÓ 
ÒI warned you, did I not, th
at there might be danger?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Ha
rry, Òbut ÑÓ 
ÒWell, then,Ó said Dumbledore, 
shaking back his sleeves once 
more and raising the empty goblet, Òyou have my orders.Ó 
ÒWhy canÕt I drink the potion in
stead?Ó asked Harry desperately. 
ÒBecause I am much older, much cleverer, and much less 
valuable,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒOnc
e and for all, Harry, do I have 
your word that you will do all in
 your power to make me keep 
drinking?Ó ÒCouldnÕt Ñ ?Ó 
ÒDo I have it?Ó 
ÒBut ÑÓ 
ÒYour word, Harry.
Ó ÒI Ñ all right, but ÑÓ 
Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore low-
ered the crystal goblet into the 
potion. For a split second, Harry 
hoped that he would not be able 
to touch the potion with the gob-
let, but the crystal sank into the 
surface as nothing else had; when 
the glass was full to th
e brim, Dumbledore lift
ed it to his mouth. 
ÒYour good health, Harry.Ó 
And he drained the goblet. Harr
y watched, terrified, his hands 
gripping the rim of the basin so ha
rd that his fingertips were numb. 
ÒProfessor?Ó he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the 
empty glass. ÒHow do you feel?Ó 
&#'""!$1'"
 037" Dumbledore shook his head, his 
eyes closed. Harry wondered 
whether he was in pain. Dumble
dore plunged the glass blindly 
back into the basin, refill
ed it, and drank once more. 
In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. 
Then, halfway through the fourth 
goblet, he staggered and fell for-
ward against the basin. His eyes 
were still closed, his breathing 
heavy. 
ÒProfessor Dumbledore?Ó said Ha
rry, his voice strained. ÒCan 
you hear me?Ó 
Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he 
was deeply asleep, but dreaming a 
horrible dream. His grip on the 
goblet was slackening; the potion 
was about to spill from it. Harry 
reached forward and gr
asped the crysta
l cup, holding it steady. 
ÒProfessor, can you hear me?Ó he repeated loudly, his voice echo-
ing around the cavern. 
Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not 
recognize, for he had never heard 
Dumbledore frightened like this. 
ÒI donÕt want . . . DonÕt make me . . .Ó 
Harry stared into the whitened fa
ce he knew so well, at the 
crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what 
to do. Ò. . . donÕt like . . 
. want to stop . . .Ó
 moaned Dumbledore. 
ÒYou . . . you canÕt stop, Professo
r,Ó said Harry. ÒYouÕve got to 
keep drinking, remember? You told
 me you had to keep drinking. 
Here . . .Ó 
Hating himself, repulsed by wh
at he was doing
, Harry forced 
the goblet back toward DumbledoreÕ
s mouth and tipped it, so that 
Dumbledore drank the remainde
r of the potion inside. 
ÒNo . . .Ó he groaned, as Harry lo
wered the goblet back into the 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 038" basin and refilled it fo
r him. ÒI donÕt want to
. . . . I donÕt want to. 
. . . Let me go. . . .Ó 
ÒItÕs all right, Professor,Ó said 
Harry, his hand shaking. ÒItÕs all 
right, IÕm here ÑÓ 
ÒMake it stop, make it st
op,Ó moaned Dumbledore. 
ÒYes . . . yes, thisÕll make it st
op,Ó lied Harry. He tipped the con-
tents of the goblet into 
DumbledoreÕs open mouth. 
Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast 
chamber, across the dead black water. 
ÒNo, no, no, no, I canÕt, I canÕ
t, donÕt make me, I donÕt want 
to. . . .Ó 
ÒItÕs all right, Professor, itÕs 
all right!Ó said 
Harry loudly, his 
hands shaking so badly he could ha
rdly scoop up th
e sixth goblet-
ful of potion; the basin was now ha
lf empty. ÒNothingÕs happening 
to you, youÕre safe, it isnÕt real, I 
swear it isnÕt real Ñ take this, now, 
take this. . . .Ó 
And obediently, Dumbledore drank,
 as though it was an anti-
dote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to 
his knees, shaking uncontrollably. 
ÒItÕs all my fault, all 
my fault,Ó he sobbed. ÒPlease make it stop, 
I know I did wrong, oh please make
 it stop and IÕll never, never 
again . . .Ó 
ÒThis will make it stop, Profes
sor,Ó Harry said, his voice crack-
ing as he tipped the seventh glas
s of potion into DumbledoreÕs 
mouth. 
Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers sur-
rounded him; his flailing hand al
most knocked the refilled goblet 
from HarryÕs trembling hands as he moaned, ÒDonÕt hurt them, 
donÕt hurt them, please, please, itÕs 
my fault, hurt me instead . . .Ó 
&#'""!$1'"
 039" ÒHere, drink this, drink this, youÕll be all right,Ó said Harry des-
perately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his 
mouth even as he kept his eyes ti
ght shut and shook from head to 
foot. And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists 
upon the ground, while Harr
y filled the ninth goblet. 
ÒPlease, please, please, no . . 
. not that, not that, IÕll do any-
thing . . .Ó 
ÒJust drink, Professor,
 just drink . . .Ó 
Dumbledore drank like a child dyin
g of thirst, but when he had 
finished, he yelled again as thou
gh his insides were on fire. ÒNo 
more, please, no more . . .Ó 
Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful 
of potion and felt the crystal 
scrape the bottom
 of the basin. 
ÒWeÕre nearly there, Professor.
 Drink this, drink it. . . .Ó He supported DumbledoreÕs shoulders and again, Dumbledore 
drained the glass; then Harry was 
on his feet once more, refilling 
the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than 
ever, ÒI want to die! I want to die!
 Make it stop, make it stop, I want 
to die!Ó 
ÒDrink this, Professor.
 Drink this. . . .Ó 
Dumbledore drank, and no sooner
 had he finished than he 
yelled, ÒKILL ME!Ó 
ÒThis Ñ this one will!Ó gasped Har
ry. ÒJust drink this . . . ItÕll 
be over . . . all over!Ó Dumbledore gulped at the goblet
, drained every last drop, and 
then, with a great, ra
ttling gasp, rolled over onto his face. 
ÒNo!Ó shouted Harry, who had stood 
to refill the goblet again; 
instead he dropped the cup into
 the basin, flung himself down 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 03:" beside Dumbledore, and heaved him
 over onto his back; Dumble-
doreÕs glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. ÒNo,Ó 
said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, Òno,
 youÕre not dead, you said it 
wasnÕt poison, wake up, wake up Ñ 
Rennervate
!Ó he cried, his 
wand pointing at DumbledoreÕs ches
t; there was a flash of red light 
but nothing happened. 
ÒRennervate Ñ sir Ñ please ÑÓ 
DumbledoreÕs eyelids flickered; HarryÕs heart leapt. 
ÒSir, are you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒWater,Ó croaked Dumbledore. 
ÒWater,Ó panted Harry. ÒYes ÑÓ 
He leapt to his feet and seized th
e goblet he had dropped in the 
basin; he barely registered the gold
en locket lying curled beneath it. 
ÒAguamenti
!Ó he shouted, jabbing th
e goblet with his wand. 
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees 
beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his 
lips Ñ but it was empty. Dumble
dore groaned and began to pant. 
ÒBut I had some Ñ wait Ñ 
Aguamenti!Ó said Harry again, 
pointing his wand at the goblet. 
Once more, for a second, clear wa-
ter gleamed within it, but as he
 approached DumbledoreÕs mouth, 
the water vanished again. 
ÒSir, IÕm trying, IÕm trying!Ó sa
id Harry desperately, but he did 
not think that Dumbledore could hear
 him; he had rolled onto his 
side and was drawing great, rattl
ing breaths that sounded agoniz-
ing. Ò
Aguamenti
 Ñ 
Aguamenti
 Ñ 
AGUAMENTI!Ó The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumble-
doreÕs breathing was fading. His br
ain whirling in panic, Harry 
knew, instinctively, the only way 
left to get water, because Volde-
mort had planne
d it so . . . 
He flung himself over to the ed
ge of the rock and plunged the 
&#'""!$1'"
 030" goblet into the lake, bringing it up
 full to the brim of icy water that 
did not vanish. 
ÒSir Ñ here!Ó Harry yelled, and 
lunging forward, he tipped the 
water clumsily over DumbledoreÕs face. 
It was the best he could do, fo
r the icy feeling on his arm not 
holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy 
white hand had gripped his wrist, 
and the creature to whom it be-
longed was pulling him, slowly, 
backward across the rock. The sur-
face of the lake was no longer mi
rror-smooth; it 
was churning, and 
everywhere Harry looked, white he
ads and hands were emerging 
from the dark water, men and 
women and children with sunken, 
sightless eyes were moving toward 
the rock: an army of the dead 
rising from the black water. 
ÒPetrificus Totalus
!Ó yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the 
smooth, soaked surface of the isla
nd as he pointed his wand at 
the Inferius that had 
his arm: It released him, falling backward 
into the water with a splash; he 
scrambled to his feet, but many 
more Inferi were already climbing 
onto the rock, their bony hands 
clawing at its slippery surface, th
eir blank, frosted eyes upon him, 
trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering. 
ÒPetrificus Totalus
!Ó Harry bellowed again, backing away as he 
swiped his wand through the air; 
six or seven of 
them crumpled, 
but more were coming toward him. Ò
Impedimenta! Incarcerous
!Ó A few of them stumbled, one or 
two of them bound in ropes, 
but those climbing onto the rock 
behind them merely stepped over 
or on the fallen bodies. Still slas
hing at the air with his wand, Harry 
yelled, Ò
Sectumsempra
! SECTUMSEMPRA
!Ó But though gashes appeared in 
their sodden rags and their icy 
skin, they had no blood to spill: 
They walked on, unfeeling, their 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 032" shrunken hands outstretched toward
 him, and as he backed away 
still farther, he felt arms enclos
e him from behind, thin, fleshless 
arms cold as death, and his feet le
ft the ground as they lifted him 
and began to carry him, slowly an
d surely, back to the water, and 
he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and 
become one more dead guardian of
 a fragment of 
VoldemortÕs shat-
tered soul. . . . 
But then, through the darkness, fi
re erupted: cr
imson and gold, 
a ring of fire that surrounded th
e rock so that the Inferi holding 
Harry so tightly stumbled and fa
ltered; they did not dare pass 
through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit 
the ground, slipped on the rock, 
and fell, grazing his arms, but 
scrambled back up, raising hi
s wand and staring around. 
Dumbledore was on his feet again,
 pale as any of the surround-
ing Inferi, but taller than any too,
 the fire dancing in his eyes; his 
wand was raised like a torch and 
from its tip emanated the flames, 
like a vast lasso, encircli
ng them all 
with warmth. 
The Inferi bumped into each othe
r, attempting, blindly, to es-
cape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . . 
Dumbledore scooped the locket fr
om the bottom of the stone 
basin and stowed it inside his ro
bes. Wordlessly, he gestured to 
Harry to come to his side. Distra
cted by the flames, the Inferi 
seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led 
Harry back to the boat, 
the ring of fire movi
ng with them, around 
them, the bewildered Inferi accompan
ying them to the waterÕs edge, 
where they slipped gratefully ba
ck into their dark waters. 
Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that 
Dumbledore might not be able to cl
imb into the boat; he staggered  
 &#'""!$1'"
 033" a little as he attempte
d it; all his efforts seem
ed to be going into 
maintaining the ring of protec
tive flame around them. Harry 
seized him and helped him back to
 his seat. Once they were both 
safely jammed inside again, the bo
at began to move back across the 
black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, 
and it seemed that the Inferi sw
arming below them did not dare 
resurface. ÒSir,Ó panted Harry, Òsir, I forg
ot Ñ about fire Ñ they were 
coming at me and I panicked ÑÓ 
ÒQuite understandable,Ó murmured Dumbledore. Harry was 
alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. 
They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, 
then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dum-
bledore reached the bank he let his 
wand hand fall; the ring of fire 
vanished, but the Inferi did not em
erge again from the water. The 
little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its 
chain slithered back into the lake
 too. Dumbledore
 gave a great 
sigh and leaned agai
nst the cavern wall. 
ÒI am weak. . . .Ó he said. 
ÒDonÕt worry, sir,Ó said Harry 
at once, anxious about Dumble-
doreÕs extreme pallor and by his air 
of exhaustion. ÒDonÕt worry, IÕll 
get us back. . . . Lean
 on me, sir. . . .Ó 
And pulling DumbledoreÕs uninjured arm around his shoulders, 
Harry guided his headmaster back ar
ound the lake, bearing most of 
his weight. 
ÒThe protection was . . . after a
ll . . . well-designed,Ó said Dum-
bledore faintly. ÒOne alone could 
not have done it. . . . You did 
well, very well, 
Harry. . . .Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-./"
 034" ÒDonÕt talk now,Ó said Harry, 
fearing how slurred DumbledoreÕs 
voice had become, how much his f
eet dragged. ÒSave your energy, 
sir. . . . WeÕll soon be
 out of here. . . .Ó 
ÒThe archway will ha
ve sealed again. . 
. . My knife . . .Ó 
ÒThereÕs no need, I got cut on th
e rock,Ó said Harry firmly. ÒJust 
tell me where. . . .Ó 
ÒHere . . .Ó 
Harry wiped his grazed forearm 
upon the stone: Having re-
ceived its tribute of blood, the 
archway reopened instantly. They 
crossed the outer cave, and Harr
y helped Dumbledore back into 
the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff. 
ÒItÕs going to be all right, sir,
Ó Harry said over and over again, 
more worried by DumbledoreÕs silence than he had been by his 
weakened voice. ÒWeÕre nearly there. . . . I can Apparate us both 
back. . . . DonÕt worry. . . .Ó 
ÒI am not worried, Harry,Ó said 
Dumbledore, his voice a little 
stronger despite the freezing 
water. ÒI am with you.Ó

 nce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore 
onto the top of the nearest bo
ulder and then to his feet. 
Sodden and shivering, DumbledoreÕs 
weight still upon him, Harry 
concentrated harder than he had 
ever done upon his destination: 
Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, 
gripping DumbledoreÕs arm as 
tightly as he could, he stepped fo
rward into that feeling of horrible 
compression. 
He knew it had worked before 
he opened his eyes: The smell of 
salt, the sea breeze had gone. He
 and Dumbledore were shivering 
and dripping in the middle of the 
dark High Street in Hogsmeade. 
For one horrible moment HarryÕs 
imagination showed him more 
Inferi creeping toward him around
 the sides of shops, but he 
blinked and saw that nothing was st
irring; all was still, the darkness 
complete but for a few street
lamps and lit upper windows. 
ÒWe did it, Professor!Ó Harry whispered with difficulty; he  
 7"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /89" suddenly realized that he had a sear
ing stitch in his chest. ÒWe did 
it! We got the Horcrux!Ó 
Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry 
thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off 
balance; then he saw his face, pale
r and damper than ever in the 
distant light of a streetlamp. 
ÒSir, are you all right?Ó 
ÒIÕve been better,Ó said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners 
of his mouth twitched. ÒThat potion 
. . . was no health
 drink. . . .Ó 
And to HarryÕs horror, Dumble
dore sank onto
 the ground. 
ÒSir Ñ itÕs okay, sir, youÕre goin
g to be all right, donÕt worry ÑÓ 
He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to 
be seen and all he could think 
was that he must somehow get 
Dumbledore quickly to 
the hospital wing. 
ÒWe need to get you up to th
e school, sir. . . . Madam Pom-
frey . . .Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒIt is 
. . . Professor Snape whom I 
need. . . . But I do not think . . . I 
can walk very far ju
st yet. . . .Ó 
ÒRight Ñ sir, listen Ñ IÕm going to knock on a door, find a 
place you can stay Ñ then 
I can run and get Madam ÑÓ 
ÒSeverus,Ó said Dumbledore clearl
y. ÒI need Severus. . . .Ó 
ÒAll right then, Snape Ñ but IÕm going to have to leave you for 
a moment so I can ÑÓ 
Before Harry could make a move
, however, he heard running 
footsteps. His heart leapt: Some
body had seen, somebody knew 
they needed help Ñ and looking 
around he saw Madam Rosmerta 
scurrying down the dark street to
ward them on high-heeled, fluffy 
slippers, wearing a silk
 dressing gown embroi
dered with dragons. 
ÒI saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! 
&#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /8:" Thank goodness, thank 
goodness, I couldnÕt 
think what to Ñ but 
whatÕs wrong with Albus?Ó 
She came to a halt, panting, an
d stared down, wide-eyed, at 
Dumbledore. ÒHeÕs hurt,Ó said Harry. ÒMadam Rosmerta, can he come into 
the Three Broomsticks while I go up
 to the school and get help for 
him?Ó ÒYou canÕt go up there alone! 
DonÕt you realize Ñ havenÕt you 
seen Ñ ? 
ÒIf you help me suppor

ÒI think we can ge

ÒWhat has happened?Ó asked Dumbledore. ÒRosmerta, whatÕs 
wrong?Ó ÒThe Ñ the Dark Mark, Albus.Ó 
And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. 
Dread flooded Harry at the sound of
 the words. . . . He turned and 
looked. 
There it was, hanging in the sk
y above the school: the blazing 
green skull with a serpent tongue, 
the mark Death Eaters left be-
hind whenever they had entered a bu
ilding . . . wherever they had 
murdered. . . . 
ÒWhen did it appear?Ó aske
d Dumbledore, and his hand 
clenched painfully upon
 HarryÕs shoulder as 
he struggled to his 
feet. ÒMust have been minutes ago, it
 wasnÕt there when I put the cat 
out, but when I got upstairs ÑÓ 
ÒWe need to return to the castle
 at once,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒRosmertaÓ Ñ and though he stagge
red a little, he seemed wholly 
in command of the situation Ñ 
Òwe need transport Ñ brooms ÑÓ

 /8;" ÒIÕve got a couple behind the bar,
Ó she said, looking very fright-
ened. ÒShall I run and fetch Ñ ?Ó 
ÒNo, Harry can do it.Ó Harry raised his wand at once. 
ÒAccio RosmertaÕs Brooms
!Ó A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the 
pub burst open; two brooms had shot
 out into the street and were 
racing each other to 
HarryÕs side, where they stopped dead, quiver-
ing slightly at waist height. 
ÒRosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,Ó said Dum-
bledore, as he mounted the broom 
nearest him. ÒIt might be that 
nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . 
Harry, put on your 
Invisibility Cloak.Ó 
Harry pulled his Cloak out of his 
pocket and threw it over him-
self before mounting his broom
: Madam Rosmerta was already 
tottering back toward her pub as
 Harry and Dumbledore kicked 
off from the ground and rose up in
to the air. As they sped toward 
the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab 
him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have 
acted upon Dumbledore like a stim
ulant: He was bent low over 
his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and 
beard flying behind him on the 
night air. And Harry too looked 
ahead at the skull, and fear swe
lled inside him like a venomous 
bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from 
his mind. . . . 
How long had they been away
? Had Ron, Hermione, and 
GinnyÕs luck run out by now? Was 
it one of them who had caused 
the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or 
some other member of the D.A.? An
d if it was . . . he was the one 
&#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /8<" who had told them to patrol the 
corridors, he had asked them to 
leave the safety of their beds. . . . 
Would he be resp
onsible, again, 
for the death of a friend? 
As they flew over the dark, tw
isting lane down which they had 
walked earlier, Harry he
ard, over the whistlin
g of the night air in 
his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. 
He thought he understood why as
 he felt his broom shudder when 
they flew over the boundary wall
 into the ground
s: Dumbledore 
was undoing the enchan
tments he himself ha
d set around the cas-
tle so they could enter at speed. 
The Dark Mark wa
s glittering di-
rectly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did 
that mean the death 
had occurred there? 
Dumbledore had already crossed 
the crenellated ramparts and 
was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and 
looked around. 
The ramparts were deserted. The door
 to the spiral staircase that 
led back into the castle was closed
. There was no sign of a struggle, 
of a fight to the 
death, of a body. 
ÒWhat does it mean?Ó Harry aske
d Dumbledore, looking up at 
the green skull with its 
serpentÕs tongue glinti
ng evilly above them. 
ÒIs it the real Mark? Has someon
e definitely been Ñ Professor?Ó 
In the dim green glow from th
e Mark, Harry saw Dumbledore 
clutching at his chest wi
th his blackened hand. 
ÒGo and wake Severus,Ó said Du
mbledore faintly but clearly. 
ÒTell him what has happened and 
bring him to me. Do nothing 
else, speak to nobody else, and do
 not remove your cloak. I shall 
wait here.Ó 
ÒBut ÑÓ 
ÒYou swore to obey me, Harry Ñ go!Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /8=" Harry hurried over to the door leadin
g to the spiral staircase, but 
his hand had only just closed upon
 the iron ring of the door when 
he heard running footsteps on the 
other side. He looked around at 
Dumbledore, who gestured him to retreat. Harry backed away, 
drawing his wand as he did so. 
The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and 
shouted, Ò
Expelliarmus!Ó HarryÕs body became instantly ri
gid and immobile, and he felt 
himself fall back against the tower wall, propped like an unsteady 
statue, unable to move or speak.
 He could not understand how it 
had happened Ñ 
Expelliarmus
 was not a Freezing Charm Ñ 
Then, by the light of the Mark
, he saw DumbledoreÕs wand fly-
ing in an arc over the edge of 
the ramparts and understood. . . . 
Dumbledore had wordlessly immobili
zed Harry, and the second he 
had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defend-
ing himself. 
Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumble-
dore still showed no sign of pani
c or distress. He merely looked 
across at his disarmer and said, ÒGood 
evening, Draco.Ó 
Malfoy stepped forward, glancing
 around quickly to check that 
he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second 
broom. 
ÒWho else is here?Ó 
ÒA question I might ask you.
 Or are you acting alone?Ó 
Harry saw MalfoyÕs pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the 
greenish glare of the Mark. 
ÒNo,Ó he said. ÒIÕve got backup. 
There are Death Eaters here in 
your school tonight.Ó 
ÒWell, well,Ó said Dumbledore, 
as though Malfoy was showing 
&#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /8/" him an ambitious homework project. ÒVery good indeed. You 
found a way to let 
them in, did you?Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Malfoy, who was panting. ÒRight under your nose 
and you never realized!Ó 
ÒIngenious,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒY
et . . . forgive me . . . where 
are they now? You seem unsupported.Ó 
ÒThey met some of your guards. TheyÕre having a fight down be-
low. They wonÕt be long. . . . I came
 on ahead. I Ñ IÕ
ve got a job to 
do.Ó ÒWell, then, you must get on 
and do it, my dear boy,Ó said 
Dumbledore softly. 
There was silence. Harry stood im
prisoned within his own in-
visible, paralyzed body, 
staring at the two of 
them, his ears strain-
ing to hear sounds of the Death Ea
tersÕ distant fight, and in front 
of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing 
but stare at Albus Dumbledore, 
who, incredibly, smiled. 
ÒDraco, Draco, you are not a killer.Ó 
ÒHow do you know?Ó sa
id Malfoy at once. 
He seemed to realize how chil
dish the words had sounded; 
Harry saw him flush in the 
MarkÕs greenish light. 
ÒYou donÕt know what IÕm capabl
e of,Ó said Malfoy more force-
fully. ÒYou donÕt know
 what IÕve done!Ó 
ÒOh yes, I do,Ó said Dumbledor
e mildly. ÒYou almost killed 
Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increas-
ing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they 
have been feeble attemp
ts. . . . So feeble, to 
be honest, that I won-
der whether your heart ha
s been really in it.Ó 
ÒIt has been in it!Ó said Malfoy
 vehemently. ÒIÕve been working 
on it all year, 
and tonight ÑÓ 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /8>" Somewhere in the depths of th
e castle below 
Harry heard a muf-
fled yell. Malfoy stiffened an
d glanced over his shoulder. 
ÒSomebody is putting up a g
ood fight,Ó said Dumbledore con-
versationally. ÒBut you were saying
 . . . yes, you have managed to 
introduce Death Eaters into my sc
hool, which, I admit, I thought 
impossible. . . . How did you do it?Ó 
But Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to whatever was 
happening below and se
emed almost as paralyzed as Harry was. 
ÒPerhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,Ó suggested 
Dumbledore. ÒWhat if your backup has been thwarted by my 
guard? As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Or-
der of the Phoenix here tonight too.
 And after all, you donÕt really 
need help. . . . I have no wand at the moment. . . . I cannot defend 
myself.Ó 
Malfoy merely st
ared at him. 
ÒI see,Ó said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved 
nor spoke. ÒYou are afraid to act until they join you.Ó 
ÒIÕm not afraid!Ó snarled Malfoy, 
though he still made no move 
to hurt Dumbledore. ÒItÕs yo
u who should be scared!Ó 
ÒBut why? I donÕt think you will 
kill me, Draco. Killing is not 
nearly as easy as the inno
cent believe. . . . So 
tell me, while we wait 
for your friends . . . how did you sm
uggle them in he
re? It seems to 
have taken you a long time 
to work out how to do it.Ó 
Malfoy looked as though he 
was fighting down the urge to 
shout, or to vomit. He gulped an
d took several deep breaths, glar-
ing at Dumbledore, his wand pointing
 directly at the latterÕs heart. 
Then, as though he could not help 
himself, he said, ÒI had to mend 
that broken Vanishing Cabinet that
 no oneÕs used for years. The 
one Montague got lost
 in last year.Ó 
&#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /80" ÒAaaah.Ó DumbledoreÕs sigh was half
 a groan. He closed his eyes 
for a moment. ÒThat was clever. . . 
. There is a pair
, I take it?Ó 
ÒIn Borgin and Burkes,Ó said Ma
lfoy, Òand they make a kind of 
passage between them. Montague to
ld me that when he was stuck 
in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he 
could hear what was going on at
 school, and sometimes what was 
going on in the shop, as if the 
cabinet was traveling between them, 
but he couldnÕt make anyone hear him. . . . In the end, he managed 
to Apparate out, even though heÕd
 never passed his test. He nearly 
died doing it. Everyone thought it 
was a really good story, but I was 
the only one who realized what 
it meant Ñ even Borgin didnÕt 
know Ñ I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hog-
warts through the cabinets if
 I fixed the broken one.Ó 
ÒVery good,Ó murmured Dumble
dore. ÒSo the Death Eaters 
were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help 
you. . . . A clever plan, a very clever
 plan . . . and, as you say, right 
under my nose.Ó 
ÒYeah,Ó said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and 
comfort from DumbledoreÕs 
praise. ÒYeah, it was!Ó 
ÒBut there were times,Ó Dumbledore went on, ÒwerenÕt there, 
when you were not sure you woul
d succeed in mending the cabi-
net? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as 
sending me a cursed necklace th
at was bound to 
reach the wrong 
hands . . . poisoning mead there 
was only the slightest chance I 
might drink. . . .Ó 
ÒYeah, well, you still didnÕt real
ize who was behind that stuff, did 
you?Ó sneered Malfoy, as Dumble
dore slid a little down the ram-
parts, the strength in his legs 
apparently fading
, and Harry strug-
gled fruitlessly, mutely, agains
t the enchantmen
t binding him. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /88" ÒAs a matter of fact, I did,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒI was sure it was 
you. ÒWhy didnÕt you stop me, 
then?Ó Malfoy demanded. 
ÒI tried, Draco. Professor Snap
e has been keeping watch over

ÒHe hasnÕt been doing 
your orders, he promised my mother ÑÓ 
ÒOf course that is

trust Professor Snape ÑÓ 
ÒWell, youÕre losing your grip, 
then!Ó sneered Malfoy. ÒHeÕs been 
offering me plenty of help Ñ wa
nting all the gl
ory for himselfÑ 
wanting a bit of the action Ñ ÔW
hat are you doing?Õ ÔDid you do 
the necklace, that was stupid, it 
could have blown everything ÑÕ 
But I havenÕt told him what IÕve
 been doing in the Room of Re-
quirement, heÕs going to wake up 
tomorrow and itÕll all be over and 
he wonÕt be the Dark LordÕs favo
rite anymore, heÕll be nothing

ÒVery gratifying,Ó said Dumbledor
e mildly. ÒWe all like appreci-
ation for our own hard work, of co
urse. But you must have had an 
accomplice, all the same . . . someone in Hogsmeade, someone 
who was able to slip Kati

Dumbledore closed his eyes again 
and nodded, as though he was 
about to fall asleep. Ò. . . of cour
se . . . Rosmerta. How long has she 
been under the Imperius Curse?Ó 
ÒGot there at last, have
 you?Ó Malfoy taunted. 
There was another yell from below, 
rather louder than the last.  
 &#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /81" Malfoy looked nervously over his 
shoulder again, then back at 
Dumbledore, who went on: ÒSo poor
 Rosmerta was forced to lurk 
in her own bathroom and pass that
 necklace to any Hogwarts stu-
dent who entered the room una
ccompanied? And the poisoned 
mead . . . well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you 
before she sent the bottle to Slugho
rn, believing that it was to be 
my Christmas present. . . . Yes, ve
ry neat . . . very neat . . . Poor 
Mr. Filch would not, of course, t
hink to check a bottle of Rosmer-
taÕs. Tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I 
thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the 
school monitored.Ó 
ÒEnchanted coins,Ó said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to 
keep talking, though his wand ha
nd was shaking badly. ÒI had one 
and she had the other and I could send her messages ÑÓ 
ÒIsnÕt that the secret method of communication the group that 
called themselves DumbledoreÕs Army used last year?Ó asked Dum-
bledore. His voice was light and 
conversational, but Harry saw him 
slip an inch lower down th
e wall as he said it. 
ÒYeah, I got the idea from them
,Ó said Malfoy, with a twisted 
smile. ÒI got the idea of pois
oning the mead from the Mudblood 
Granger as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not 
recognizing potions.Ó 
ÒPlease do not use that offensive 
word in front of me,Ó said 
Dumbledore. Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. ÒYou
 care about me saying ÔMud-
bloodÕ when IÕm abou
t to kill you?Ó 
ÒYes, I do,Ó said Dumbledore, and 
Harry saw his feet slide a lit-
tle on the floor as
 he struggled to remain up
right. ÒBut as for being  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /19" about to kill me, Draco, you have
 had several long minutes now, 
we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have 
dreamed of finding me, and stil
l you have not acted. . . .Ó 
MalfoyÕs mouth contorted involuntar
ily, as though he had tasted 
something very bitter. 
ÒNow, about tonight,Ó Dumbledore went on, ÒI am a little 
puzzled about how it happened. . . 
. You knew that I had left the 
school? But of course,Ó he answ
ered his own question, ÒRosmerta 
saw me leaving, she tipped you of
f using your ingenious coins, IÕm 
sure. ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Malfoy. ÒBut 
she said you were just going for 
a drink, youÕd be back. . . .Ó 
ÒWell, I certainly did have a drink 
. . . and I came 
back . . . after 
a fashion,Ó mumbled Dumbledore. 
ÒSo you decided 
to spring a 
trap for me?Ó 
ÒWe decided to put the Dark Ma
rk over the tower and get you 
to hurry up here, to see whoÕd be
en killed,Ó said Malfoy. ÒAnd it 
worked!Ó 
ÒWell . . . yes and no 
. . .Ó said Dumbledore
. ÒBut am I to take 
it, then, that nobody has been murdered?Ó 
ÒSomeoneÕs dead,Ó said Malfoy, and 
his voice seemed to go up an 
octave as he said it. ÒOne of your people . . . I donÕt know who, it 
was dark. . . . I stepped over the 
body. . . . I was supposed to be 
waiting up here when you got back
, only your Phoenix lot got in 
the way. . . .Ó 
ÒYes, they do that,Ó said Dumbledore. 
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it 
sounded as though people
 were fighting on th
e actual spiral stair-
case that led to where Dumbledor
e, Malfoy, and Harry stood, and 
&#'""234#&*3*4","

 /1:" HarryÕs heart thundered 
unheard in his invisibl
e chest. . . . Some-
one was dead. . . . Malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who 
was it? 
ÒThere is little time, one way or
 another,Ó said Dumbledore. ÒSo 
let us discuss your options, Draco.Ó 
ÒMy options!Ó said Malfoy loudly
. ÒIÕm standing here with a 
wand Ñ IÕm about to kill you ÑÓ 
ÒMy dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you 
were going to kill me, you woul
d have done it when you first dis-
armed me, you would not have stoppe

ways and means.Ó 
ÒI havenÕt got any options!Ó sa
id Malfoy, and he was suddenly 
white as Dumbledore. ÒIÕve got to do 
it! HeÕll kill me! HeÕll kill my 
whole family!Ó 
ÒI appreciate the difficulty of your position,Ó said Dumbledore. 
ÒWhy else do you think I have no
t confronted you before now? Be-
cause I knew that you would have
 been murdered if Lord Volde-
mort realized that I suspected you.Ó 
Malfoy winced at the sound of the name. 
ÒI did not dare speak to you of
 the mission with which I knew 
you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,Ó 
continued Dumbledore. ÒBut now at
 last we can speak plainly to 
each other. . . . No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, 
though you are very lucky that 
your unintentional victims sur-
vived. . . . I can help you, Draco.Ó 
ÒNo, you canÕt,Ó said Malfoy, his
 wand hand shaking very badly 
indeed. ÒNobody can. He 
told me to do it or he
Õll kill me. IÕve got 
no choice.Ó

completely than you can possibly im

members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her like-
wise. Your father is safe at the 
moment in Azkaban. . . . When the 
time comes, we can protect him too. Come over to the right side, 
Draco . . . you are not a killer. . . .Ó 
Malfoy stared at Dumbledore. 
ÒBut I got this far, didnÕt I?Ó he
 said slowly. ÒThey thought IÕd die 
in the attempt, but IÕm here . . . 
and youÕre in my power. . . . IÕm 
the one with the wand. . . . Yo

ÒNo, Draco,Ó said Dumbledore quietly. ÒIt is my mercy, and not 
yours, that matters now.Ó 
Malfoy did not speak. His mouth 
was open, his wand hand still 
trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction Ñ 
But suddenly footsteps 
were thundering up the stairs, and a sec-
ond later Malfoy 
was buffeted out of the 
way as four people in 
black robes burst through the door 
onto the ramparts. Still para-
lyzed, his eyes staring unblinking
ly, Harry gazed in terror upon 
four strangers: It seemed the Deat
h Eaters had won the fight below. 
A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy 
giggle. 
ÒDumbledore cornered!Ó he said, an
d he turned to a stocky little 
woman who looked as though she 
could be his sister and who was 
grinning eagerly. ÒDumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well 
done, Draco, well done!Ó 
ÒGood evening, Amycus,Ó said Du
mbledore calmly, as though 
welcoming the man to a tea party. 
ÒAnd youÕve brought Alecto too. 
. . . Charming . . .Ó 
 &#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /1<" The woman gave an angry little titter. ÒThink your little jokesÕll 
help you on your deathb
ed then?Ó she jeered. 
ÒJokes? No, no, these are manners,Ó replied Dumbledore. 
ÒDo it,Ó said the stranger standi
ng nearest to Harry, a big, rangy 
man with matted gray hair an
d whiskers, whos
e black Death 
EaterÕs robes looked uncomfortably 
tight. He had a voice like none 
that Harry had ever heard: a rasp
ing bark of a voice. Harry could 
smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, unmistakably, of 
blood coming from him. His filthy 
hands had long yellowish nails. 
ÒIs that you, Fenrir
?Ó asked Dumbledore. 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó rasped the other. 
ÒPleased to see me, Dumbledore?Ó 
ÒNo, I cannot say that I am.Ó 
Greyback grinned, showing poin
ted teeth. Blood trickled down 
his chin and he licked hi
s lips slowly, obscenely. 
ÒBut you know how much 
I like kids, Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒAm I to take it that you are 
attacking even without the full 
moon now? This is most unusual.
 . . . You have developed a taste 
for human flesh that cannot be
 satisfied once a month?Ó 
ÒThatÕs right,Ó said Fenrir Grey
back. ÒShocks you that, does it, 
Dumbledore? Frightens you?Ó 
ÒWell, I cannot pretend it does no
t disgust me a little,Ó said 
Dumbledore. ÒAnd, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here in-
vited you, of all people, into the sc
hool where his friends live. . . .Ó 
ÒI didnÕt,Ó breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Fenrir; he did 
not seem to want to even glance at
 him. ÒI didnÕt know he was go-
ing to come ÑÓ 
ÒI wouldnÕt want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,Ó 
rasped Greyback. ÒNot when there ar
e throats to be ripped out. . . 
Delicious, delicious . . .Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /1=" And he raised a yellow fingernail 
and picked at his front teeth, 
leering at Dumbledore. ÒI could 
do you for afters, Dumbledore.Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, bru-
tal-looking face. ÒWeÕve got orde
rs. DracoÕs got to do it. Now, 
Draco, and quickly.Ó 
Malfoy was showing less resolution
 than ever. He looked terri-
fied as he stared into Dumbledo
reÕs face, which was even paler, 
and rather lower than usual, as he
 had slid so far down the rampart 
wall. ÒHeÕs not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!Ó said the 
lopsided man, to the accompanim
ent of his sisterÕs wheezing gig-
gles. ÒLook at him Ñ 
whatÕs happened to 
you, then, Dumby?Ó 
ÒOh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,Ó said Dumble-
dore. ÒOld age, in short . . . One 
day, perhaps, it will happen to 
you . . . if you are lucky. . . .Ó 
ÒWhatÕs that mean, then, whatÕs 
that mean?Ó yelled the Death 
Eater, suddenly violent. ÒAlways the same, werenÕt yeh, Dumby, 
talking and doing nothing, nothing. I donÕt even know why the 
Dark LordÕs bothering to kill 
yer! Come on, Draco, do it!Ó 
But at that moment there were re
newed sounds of scuffling from 
below and a voice shouted, Ò
TheyÕve blocked the stairs 
Ñ Reducto
! REDUCTO!Ó HarryÕs heart leapt: So these four
 had not eliminated all opposi-
tion, but merely broken through th
e fight to the top of the tower, 
and, by the sound of it, crea
ted a barrier behind them Ñ 
ÒNow, Draco, quickly!Ó said th
e brutal-faced man angrily. 
But MalfoyÕs hand was shaking so
 badly that he could barely 
aim.  &#'""234#&*3*4","
-&(5!6""&7)'("
 /1/" ÒIÕll do it,Ó snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his 
hands outstretched, 
his teeth bared. 
ÒI said no!Ó shouted the brutal-f
aced man; there was a flash of 
light and the werewolf was blasted 
out of the way; he hit the ram-
parts and staggered, looking furi
ous. HarryÕs hear
t was hammering 
so hard it seemed impossible that
 nobody could hear him standing 
there, imprisoned by DumbledoreÕs 
spell Ñ if he could only move, 
he could aim a curse from under the cloak Ñ 
ÒDraco, do it or stand aside so
 one of us ÑÓ screeched the 
woman, but at that precise moment
, the door to the ramparts burst 
open once more and there stood Snap
e, his wand clutched in his 
hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped 
against the wall, to the four De
ath Eaters, including the enraged 
werewolf, and Malfoy. 
ÒWeÕve got a problem, Snape,Ó said the lumpy Amycus, whose 
eyes and wand were fixed alike up
on Dumbledore, Òthe boy doesnÕt 
seem able ÑÓ 
But somebody else had spoken SnapeÕs name, quite softly. 
ÒSeverus . . .Ó 
The sound frightened Harry beyo
nd anything he had experi-
enced all evening. Fo
r the first time, Dumb
ledore was pleading. 
Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy 
roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a 
word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. 
Snape gazed for a moment at Du
mbledore, and there was revul-
sion and hatred etched in 
the harsh lines of his face. ÒSeverus . . . 
please . . .Ó 
Snape raised his wand and pointe
d it directly at Dumbledore. 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,-'.'*"
 /1>" ÒAvada Kedavra
!Ó A jet of green light shot from the end of SnapeÕs wand and hit 
Dumbledore squarely in the chest. HarryÕs scream of horror never 
left him; silent and unmoving, he 
was forced to watch as Dumble-
dore was blasted into the air. For a 
split second, he seemed to hang 
suspended beneath the shining skull,
 and then he fell slowly back-
ward, like a great rag doll, over 
the battlements and out of sight.

 arry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; 
it had not happened.
 . . . It could not have happened.
 . . . ÒOut of here, quickly,Ó said Snape. 
He seized Malfoy by the scru
ff of the neck and forced him 
through the door ahead of the rest
; Greyback and the squat brother 
and sister followed, the latter both
 panting excitedly. As they van-
ished through the door, Harry realized
 he could move again. What 
was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but 
horror and shock. He threw the Invi
sibility Cloak aside as the bru-
tal-faced Death Eater, last to le
ave the tower top, was disappearing 
through the door. 
ÒPetrificus Totalus
!Ó The Death Eater buckled as though
 hit in the back with some-
thing solid and fell to the ground
, rigid as a waxw
ork, but he had 
barely hit the floor when Harry wa
s clambering over him and run-
ning down the darkened staircase. 
#"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,'-.#&"
 /05" Terror tore at HarryÕs heart. . 
. . He had to get to Dumbledore 
and he had to catch Snape. . . . Somehow the two things were 
linked. . . . He could reverse wh
at had happened if he had them 
both together. . . . Dumbledore
 could not have died. . . . 
He leapt the last ten steps of 
the spiral staircase and stopped 
where he landed, his wa
nd raised: The dimly li
t corridor was full of 
dust; half the ceiling seemed to 
have fallen in; and a battle was rag-
ing before him, but even as he attempted to make out who was 
fighting whom, he heard 
the hated voice shout, Ò
ItÕs over, time to 
go!Ó and saw Snape disappearing around
 the corner at the far end of 
the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way 
through the fight unscathed. As 
Harry plunged after them, one of 
the fighters detached themselves fr
om the fray and flew at him: It 
was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry 
could raise his wand: Harry fell ba
ckward, with filthy matted hair 
in his face, the stench of swea
t and blood filling his nose and 
mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat Ñ 
ÒPetrificus Totalus
!Ó Harry felt Fenrir collapse agai
nst him; with a stupendous effort 
he pushed the werewolf off and onto
 the floor as a jet of green light 
came flying toward him; he ducked
 and ran, headfirst, into the 
fight. His feet met something squa
shy and slippery on the floor and 
he stumbled: There were two bodies
 lying there, lying facedown in 
a pool of blood, but there was no 
time to investigate. Harry now 
saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in 
combat with the lumpy Death Ea
ter, Amycus, who was throwing 
hex after hex at her while she dodg
ed them: Amycus was giggling, 
enjoying the sport: Ò
Crucio Ñ 
Crucio Ñ you canÕt dance forever, 
pretty ÑÓ 
23-.#&""42""&#'""%(-*!'"
 /00" ÒImpedimenta
!Ó yelled Harry. 
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest:
 He gave a piglike squeal of 
pain, was lifted off his feet and sla
mmed into the opposite wall, slid 
down it, and fell out of sight behi
nd Ron, Professor McGonagall, 
and Lupin, each of whom was bat
tling a separate Death Eater. Be-
yond them, Harry saw Tonks fighti
ng an enormous blond wizard 
who was sending curses flying in al
l directions, so that they rico-
cheted off the walls around them, 
cracking stone, shattering the 
nearest window Ñ 
ÒHarry, where did you come from?Ó Ginny cried, but there was 
no time to answer her. He put hi
s head down and sprinted forward, 
narrowly avoiding a bl
ast that erupted over his head, showering 
them all in bits of wall. Snape mu
st not escape, he must catch up 
with Snape Ñ 
ÒTake that
!Ó shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed 
the female Death Eater, Alecto, 
sprinting away down the corridor 
with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He 
launched himself after them but his
 foot caught on something, and 
next moment he was lying across someoneÕs legs. Looking around, 
he saw NevilleÕs pale, round 
face flat against the floor. 
ÒNeville, are you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒMÕall right,Ó muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, 
ÒHarry . . . Snape ÕnÕ Malf
oy . . . ran past . . .Ó ÒI know, IÕm on it!Ó said Harry, 
aiming a hex from the floor at 
the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the 
chaos. The man gave a howl of pain
 as the spell hit him in the face: 
He wheeled around, staggered, 
and then pounded away after the 
brother and sister. Harry scrambled 
up from the floor and began to 
sprint along the corridor, ignoring
 the bangs issuing from behind

 677" him, the yells of the others to come
 back, and the mute call of the 
figures on the ground whose fa
te he did not yet know. . . . 
He skidded around the corner, his
 trainers slippery with blood; 
Snape had an immense head start. 
Was it possible th
at he had al-
ready entered the cabinet in the R
oom of Requirement, or had the 
Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreat-
ing that way? He could hear no
thing but his own pounding feet, 
his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty cor-
ridor, but then spotted a bloody foot
print that showed at least one 
of the fleeing Death Eaters was 
heading toward the front doors Ñ 
perhaps the Room of Requir
ement was indeed blocked Ñ 
He skidded around another corner
 and a curse flew past him; he 
dived behind a suit of armor that
 exploded. He saw the brother and 
sister running down the marble stai
rcase ahead and aimed jinxes at 
them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the 
landing, who ran scre
eching into neighborin
g paintings. As he 
leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; 
other people within the castle 
seemed to have awoken. . . . 
He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and 
sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have 
reached the grounds by now. Reme
mbering to leap the vanishing 
step halfway down the concealed 
staircase, he burst through a 
tapestry at the bottom and out in
to a corridor where a number of 
bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood. 
ÒHarry! We heard a noise, and someone said something about 
the Dark Mark ÑÓ began Ernie Macmillan. 
ÒOut of the way!Ó yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he 
sprinted toward the landing and 
down the remainder of the marble 
staircase. The oak front doors ha
d been blasted open, there were 
23-.#&""42""&#'""%(-*!'"
 678" smears of blood on th
e flagstones, and seve
ral terrified students 
stood huddled against th
e walls, one or two still cowering with 
their arms over their faces. Th
e giant Gryffindor hourglass had 
been hit by a curse, and the rubies 
within were still falling, with a 
loud rattle, onto the flagstones below. 
Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: 
He could just make out three figu
res racing across the lawn, heading 
for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate Ñ by the looks 
of them, the huge blond Death Eate
r and, some way ahead of him, 
Snape and Malfoy . . . 
The cold night air ripp
ed at HarryÕs lungs as he tore after them; 
he saw a flash of light 
in the distance that momentarily silhouetted 
his quarry. He did not know what 
it was but continued to run, not 
yet near enough to get 
a good aim with a curse Ñ 
Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry under-
stood: Hagrid had emerged from his
 cabin and was trying to stop 
the Death Eaters escaping, and th
ough every breath seemed to 
shred his lungs and the stitch in 
his chest was like fire, Harry sped 
up as an unbidden voice in his head said: 
not Hagrid . . . not Ha-
grid too
 . . . 
Something caught Harry hard in 
the small of the back and he 
fell forward, his face smacking 
the ground, blood 
pouring out of 
both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that 
the brother and sister he had ov
ertaken using his shortcut were 
closing in behind him. . . . 
ÒImpedimenta!Ó he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close 
to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who 
stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and 
sprinted on after Snape. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,'-.#&"
 679" And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the 
light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the 
blond Death Eater was aiming curs
e after curse at the gamekeeper; 
but HagridÕs immense st
rength and the tough
ened skin he had in-
herited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. 
Snape and Malfoy, however, were st
ill running; they would soon be 
beyond the gates, ab
le to Disapparate Ñ 
Harry tore past Hagrid and his 
opponent, took aim at SnapeÕs 
back, and yelled, Ò
Stupefy
!Ó He missed; the jet of red light soared past SnapeÕs head; Snape 
shouted, Ò
Run, Draco
!Ó and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry 
looked at each other before ra
ising their wands simultaneously. 
ÒCruc ÑÓ 
But Snape parried the curse, kn
ocking Harry backward off his 
feet before he could complete it
; Harry rolled over and scrambled 
back up again as the huge De
ath Eater behind him yelled, Ò
Incen-dio!Ó Harry heard an explosive ba
ng and a dancing orange light 
spilled over all of them: HagridÕs house was on fire. 
ÒFangÕs in there, yer evil
 Ñ !Ó Hagrid bellowed. 
ÒCruc ÑÓ yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the fig-
ure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked 
the spell again. Harry 
could see him sneering. 
ÒNo Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!Ó he shouted over the 
rushing of the flames, HagridÕs yells, and the wild yelping of the 
trapped Fang. ÒYou havenÕt got the nerve or the ability ÑÓ 
ÒIncarc ÑÓ Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an 
almost lazy flick of his arm. 
ÒFight back!Ó Harry screamed 
at him. ÒFight back, you cow-
ardly ÑÓ 
23-.#&""42""&#'""%(-*!'"
 67:" ÒCoward, did you call me, Potter?Ó shouted Snape. ÒYour father 
would never attack me unless it wa
s four on one, what would you 
call him, I wonder?Ó 
ÒStupe
 ÑÓ 
ÒBlocked again and again and agai
n until you learn to keep your 
mouth shut and your mind closed
, Potter!Ó sneered Snape, deflect-
ing the curse once more. ÒNow 
come!Ó he shouted at the huge 
Death Eater behind Harry. ÒIt is ti
me to be gone, before the Min-
istry turns up ÑÓ 
ÒImpedi
 ÑÓ 
But before he could finish this 
jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; 
he keeled over in the grass. 
Someone was screaming, he would 
surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or 
madness Ñ 
ÒNo!Ó roared SnapeÕs voice and th
e pain stopped as
 suddenly as 
it had started; Harry lay curled on
 the dark grass, clutching his 
wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, 
ÒHave you forgotten our orders? 
Potter belongs to the Dark 
Lord Ñ we are to le
ave him! Go! Go!Ó 
And Harry felt the ground shudder 
under his face as the brother 
and sister and the enormous Deat
h Eater obeyed, running toward 
the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate
 yell of rage: In that instant, 
he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet 
again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as 
much as he hated Voldemort himself Ñ 
ÒSectum
 Ñ !Ó 
Snape flicked his wand and the cu
rse was repelled yet again; but 
Harry was mere feet away now and he
 could see SnapeÕs face clearly 
at last: He was no longer sneering
 or jeering; the blazing flames

 67;" showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentra-
tion, Harry thought, 
Levi
 Ñ 
ÒNo, Potter!Ó screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and 
Harry was soaring backward, hittin
g the ground hard again, and 
this time his wand flew out of 
his hand. He could hear Hagrid 
yelling and Fang howling as Snap
e closed in and looked down on 
him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had 
been. SnapeÕs pale face, illuminate
d by the flaming cabin, was suf-
fused with hatred just as it 
had been before he had cursed 
Dumbledore. ÒYou dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who in-
vented them Ñ I, the Half-Blood Prince! And youÕd turn my in-
ventions on me, like your filthy 
father, would you? I donÕt think so 
. . . no!Ó Harry had dived for his wand; Snape 
shot a hex at it and it flew 
feet away into the dark
ness and out of sight. 
ÒKill me then,Ó panted Harry, who 
felt no fear at all, but only 
rage and contempt. ÒKill me like
 you killed him, you coward ÑÓ 
ÒDONÕTÑÓ screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly de-
mented, inhuman, as though he wa
s in as much pain as the yelp-
ing, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them Ñ 
ÒCALL ME COWARD!Ó 
And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike some-
thing hit him across the face and 
was slammed backward into the 
ground. Spots of light burst in fr
ont of his eyes and for a moment 
all the breath seemed 
to have gone from his body, then he heard a 
rush of wings above him and so
mething enormous obscured the 
stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snap
e, who staggered backward as the 
razor-sharp claws slashed at him. 
As Harry raised himself into a sit-
23-.#&""42""&#'""%(-*!'"
 67/" ting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the 
ground, he saw Snape running as 
hard as he could, the enormous 
beast flapping behind him and sc
reeching as Harry had never heard 
him screech Ñ 
Harry struggled to his feet, lo
oking around groggily for his 
wand, hoping to give 
chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled 
in the grass, discarding twigs, he
 knew it would be too late, and 
sure enough, by the time he had 
located his wand, he turned only 
to see the hippogriff circling the 
gates. Snape had managed to Dis-
apparate just beyond the schoolÕs boundaries. 
ÒHagrid,Ó muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. 
ÒHAGRID?Ó He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure 
emerged from out of the flames ca
rrying Fang on his back. With a 
cry of thankfulness, Ha
rry sank to his knees;
 he was shaking in 
every limb, his body ached all over
, and his breath came in painful 
stabs. ÒYeh all righÕ, Harry? Yeh all ri
ghÕ? Speak ter me
, Harry. . . .Ó 
HagridÕs huge, hairy face was 
swimming above Harry, blocking 
out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put 
out a hand and felt FangÕs reassu
ringly warm and alive body quiv-
ering beside him. 
ÒIÕm all right,Ó panted
 Harry. ÒAre you?Ó 
ÒÕCourse I am . . . take mo
reÕn that ter finish me.Ó 
Hagrid put his hands under Harr
yÕs arms and raised him up 
with such force that HarryÕs feet
 momentarily left the ground be-
fore Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling 
down HagridÕs cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was 
swelling rapidly. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,'-.#&"
 676" ÒWe should put out your house,Ó 
said Harry, Òthe charmÕs ÔAgua-
mentiÕ . . .Ó 
ÒKnew it was summat like that
,Ó mumbled Hagrid, and he 
raised a smoldering pink, fl
owery umbrella and said, Ò
Aguamenti!Ó A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand 
arm, which felt like lead, and murmured Ò
AguamentiÓ too: To-
gether, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last 
flame was extinguished. 
ÒSÕnot too bad,Ó said Hagrid hop
efully a few minutes later, look-
ing at the smoking wreck. ÒNothi
nÕ Dumbledore wonÕ be able to 
put righÕ . . .Ó 
Harry felt a searing pain in hi
s stomach at the sound of the 
name. In the silence an
d the stillness, horror
 rose inside him. 
ÒHagrid . . .Ó 
ÒI was bindinÕ up a couple oÕ bowtruckle legs when I heard Õem 
cominÕ,Ó said Hagrid sadly, stil
l staring at his wrecked cabin. 
ÒTheyÕllÕve bin burnt 
ter twigs, poor li
ttle things. . . .Ó 
ÒHagrid . . .Ó 
ÒBut what happened, Harry? I jusÕ
 saw them Death Eaters run-
ninÕ down from the castle, but what
 the ruddy hell was Snape doinÕ 
with Õem? WhereÕs he gone
 Ñ was he chasinÕ them?Ó 
ÒHe . . .Ó Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the 
smoke. ÒHagrid, 
he killed . . .Ó 
ÒKilled?Ó said Hagrid loudly, 
staring down at Harry. ÒSnape 
killed? WhatÕre yeh on abouÕ, Harry?Ó 
ÒDumbledore,Ó said Harry. ÒSna
pe killed . . . Dumbledore.Ó 
Hagrid simply looked at him, the 
little of his face that could be 
seen completely blank, uncomprehending. 
ÒDumbledore whaÕ, Harry?Ó 
23-.#&""42""&#'""%(-*!'"
 671" ÒHeÕs dead. Snape ki
lled him. . . .Ó 
ÒDonÕ say that,Ó said Hagrid roughly. ÒSnape kill Dumble-
dore Ñ donÕ be stup
id, Harry. WhaÕs made yeh say thaÕ?Ó 
ÒI saw it happen.Ó 
ÒYeh couldnÕ have.Ó 
ÒI saw it, Hagrid.Ó 
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sym-
pathetic, and Harry knew that Hagr
id thought he had sustained a 
blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects 
of a jinx. . . . 
ÒWhat musta happened was, Dumb
ledore musta told Snape ter 
go with them Death Eaters,Ó Hagr
id said confidently. ÒI suppose 
heÕs gotta keep his cover. Look, le
tÕs get yeh back up ter the school. 
Come on, Harry. . . .Ó 
Harry did not attempt to argue or
 explain. He was still shaking 
uncontrollably. Hagrid would find 
out soon enough, too soon. . . . 
As they directed their steps back 
toward the castle, Harry saw that 
many of its windows were lit now.
 He could imagine, clearly, the 
scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each 
other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over 
Hogwarts, that somebody must
 have been killed. . . . 
The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out 
onto the drive and the 
lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned 
people were creeping down the step
s, looking around nervously for 
some sign of the Death Eaters wh
o had fled into the night. HarryÕs 
eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest 
tower. He imagined that he could 
see a black, huddled mass lying in 
the grass there, though he was really
 too far away to see anything of 
the sort. Even as he stared wordle
ssly at the place where he thought 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,'-.#&"
 675" DumbledoreÕs body must lie, howeve
r, he saw people beginning to 
move toward it. 
ÒWhatÕre they all lookinÕ at?Ó 
said Hagrid, as he and Harry ap-
proached the castle front, Fang keep
ing as close as he could to their 
ankles. ÒWhaÕs thaÕ, lyinÕ on the grass?Ó Hagrid added sharply, 
heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a 
small crowd was congrega
ting. ÒSee it, Harry? Ri
ghÕ at the foot oÕ 
the tower? Under where the Mark 
. . . Blimey . . . yeh donÕ think 
someone got thrown Ñ ?Ó 
Hagrid fell silent, the thought ap
parently too horrible to express 
aloud. Harry walked alongside hi
m, feeling the aches and pains in 
his face and his legs where the vari
ous hexes of the 
last half hour 
had hit him, though in an oddly 
detached way, as though some-
body near him was suffering them. 
What was real and inescapable 
was the awful pressing feel
ing in his chest. . . . 
He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring 
crowd to the very front, where th
e dumbstruck students and teach-
ers had left a gap. 
Harry heard HagridÕs moan of pa
in and shock, but he did not 
stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where 
Dumbledore lay and crouched dow
n beside him. He had known 
there was no hope from the moment
 that the full Body-Bind Curse 
Dumbledore had placed upon him li
fted, known that it could have 
happened only because its caster 
was dead, but ther
e was still no 
preparation for seeing him here, sp
read-eagled, broken: the greatest 
wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. 
DumbledoreÕs eyes were closed; bu
t for the strange angle of his 
arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, 
straightened the half-moon specta
cles upon the crooked nose, and 
23-.#&""42""&#'""%(-*!'"
 670" wiped a trickle of blood 
from the mouth with 
his own sleeve. Then 
he gazed down at the wise old fa
ce and tried to absorb the enor-
mous and incomprehensible trut
h: that never again would Dum-
bledore speak to him, never 
again could he help. . . . 
The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a 
long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something 
hard and looked down. 
The locket they had managed to 
steal so many hours before had 
fallen out of DumbledoreÕs pocket
. It had opened, perhaps due to 
the force with which it hit the gr
ound. And although he could not 
feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry 
knew, as he picked it up, that 
there was something wrong. . . . 
He turned the locket over in his 
hands. This was neither as large 
as the locket he remembered seeing
 in the Pensieve, nor were there 
any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate 
S that was supposed to 
be SlytherinÕs mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a 
scrap of folded parchment wedged
 tightly into the place where a 
portrait should have been. 
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, 
Harry pulled out the fragment of pa
rchment, opened it, and read by 
the light of the many 
wands that had now been lit behind him:

 687" Harry neither knew nor cared wh
at the message meant. Only 
one thing mattered: This was 
not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had 
weakened himself by drinking th
at terrible potion for nothing. 
Harry crumpled the parchment in 
his hand, and his eyes burned 
with tears as behind him Fang began to howl. 
!"#"$"%"&"'"(""&")"'"*"&"+","*"-"*"'"
"".//" &#'"%#0'*-1"2$3'*&"
   Õmere, Harry . . .Ó 
ÒNo.Ó 
ÒYeh canÕ stay here, Harry. 
. . . Come on, now. . . .Ó 
ÒNo.Ó 
He did not want to leave Dumble
doreÕs side, he did not want to 
move anywhere. HagridÕs hand on his shoulder was trembling. 
Then another voice said
, ÒHarry, come on.Ó 
A much smaller and warmer ha
nd had enclosed his and was 
pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking 
about it. Only as he walked blin
dly back through the crowd did he 
realize, from a trace of flowery sc
ent on the air, that it was Ginny 
who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices 
battered him, sobs and shouts an
d wails stabbed the night, but 
Harry and Ginny walked on, back 
up the steps into the entrance 
hall. Faces swam on the edges of Ha
rryÕs vision, people were peering  
 !"!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 ./4" at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on 
the floor like drops of blood as 
they made their way toward the 
marble staircase. 
ÒWeÕre going to the hospital wing,Ó said Ginny. 
ÒIÕm not hurt,Ó said Harry. 
ÒItÕs McGonagallÕs orders,Ó sa
id Ginny. ÒEveryoneÕs up there, 
Ron and Hermione and Lu
pin and everyone ÑÓ 
Fear stirred in HarryÕs chest agai
n: He had forgotten the inert 
figures he had left behind. 
ÒGinny, who else is dead?Ó 
ÒDonÕt worry, none of us.Ó 
ÒBut the Dark Mark Ñ Malfoy said he stepped over a body ÑÓ 
ÒHe stepped over Bill, but it
Õs all right, heÕs alive.Ó 
There was something in her voic
e, however, that Harry knew 
boded ill. 
ÒAre you sure?Ó 
ÒOf course IÕm sure . . . heÕs a Ñ 
a bit of a mess, thatÕs all. Grey-
back attacked him. Madam Pomfre
y says he wonÕt Ñ wonÕt look 
the same anymore. . . .Ó 
GinnyÕs voice trembled a little. 
ÒWe donÕt really know what the aftereffects will be Ñ I mean, 
Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.Ó 
ÒBut the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . .Ó 
ÒNeville and Professor Flitwick
 are both hurt, but Madam Pom-
frey says theyÕll be all right. And 
a Death EaterÕs dead, he got hit by 
a Killing Curse that huge blond 
one was firing off everywhere Ñ 
Harry, if we hadnÕt had your Felix potion, I think weÕd all have been 
killed, but everything seem
ed to just miss us ÑÓ 
 &#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 ./5" They had reached the hospital
 wing. Pushing open the doors, 
Harry saw Neville lying, apparently
 asleep, in a bed near the door. 
Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around 
another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors 
opening, they all looked up. He
rmione ran to Harry and hugged 
him; Lupin moved forward 
too, looking anxious. 
ÒAre you all right, Harry?Ó 
ÒIÕm fine. . . . HowÕs Bill?Ó 
Nobody answered. Harry looked over HermioneÕs shoulder and 
saw an unrecognizable face lying on
 BillÕs pillow, so badly slashed 
and ripped that he looked grotes
que. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing 
at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry re-
membered how Snape had mended MalfoyÕs 
Sectumsempra
 wounds 
so easily with his wand. 
ÒCanÕt you fix them with a char
m or something?Ó he asked the 
matron. 
ÒNo charm will work on these,Ó said Madam Pomfrey. ÒIÕve tried 
everything I know, but there is 
no cure for werewolf bites.Ó 
ÒBut he wasnÕt bitten at the full
 moon,Ó said Ron, who was gaz-
ing down into his brotherÕs face as though he could somehow force 
him to mend just by staring. ÒGreyback hadnÕt transformed, so 
surely Bill wonÕt be a Ñ a real Ñ ?Ó 
He looked uncertainly at Lupin. 
ÒNo, I donÕt think that Bill will 
be a true werewolf
,Ó said Lupin, 
Òbut that does not mean that th
ere wonÕt be some contamination. 
Those are cursed wounds. They ar
e unlikely ever to heal fully, 
and Ñ and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from 
now on.Ó 
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 ./6" ÒDumbledore might know someth
ing thatÕd wo
rk, though,Ó 
Ron said. ÒWhere is he? Bill fo
ught those maniacs on Dumble-
doreÕs orders, Dumbledore owes him
, he canÕt leave him in this 
state ÑÓ 
ÒRon Ñ DumbledoreÕs dead,Ó said Ginny. ÒNo!Ó Lupin looked wildly from
 Ginny to Harry, as though 
hoping the latter might contradict
 her, but when Harry did not, 
Lupin collapsed into a chair beside BillÕs bed, his hands over his 
face. Harry had never seen Lupin lo
se control before; he felt as 
though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He 
turned away and caught RonÕs eye instead, exchanging in silence a 
look that confirmed what Ginny had said. 
ÒHow did he die?Ó whispered Tonks. ÒHow
 did it happen?Ó 
ÒSnape killed him,Ó said Harry. ÒI 
was there, I saw it. We arrived 
back on the Astronomy 
Tower because thatÕs where the Mark was. 
. . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak
, but I think he realized it was 
a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobi-
lized me, I couldnÕt do anything, I was under the Invisibility 
Cloak Ñ and then Malfoy came 
through the door and disarmed 
him ÑÓ 
Hermione clapped her hands to
 her mouth and Ron groaned. 
LunaÕs mouth trembled. 
ÒÑ more Death Eaters arrived Ñ and then Snape Ñ and Snape 
did it. The 
Avada Kedavra.
Ó Harry couldnÕt go on. 
Madam Pomfrey burst in
to tears. Nobody paid her any atten-
tion except Ginny, who wh
ispered, ÒShh! Listen!Ó 
Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed he
r fingers to her mouth, her 
eyes wide. Somewhere out in the 
darkness, a phoenix was singing 
in a way Harry had never heard befo
re: a stricken lament of terri-
&#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 ./7" ble beauty. And Harry felt, as 
he had felt about phoenix song 
before, that the music was inside 
him, not without: It was his own 
grief turned magically to song th
at echoed across the grounds and 
through the castle windows. 
How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor 
why it seemed to ease their pain 
a little to listen to the sound of 
their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital 
door opened again and Professor 
McGonagall entered the ward. 
Like all the rest, she bore marks 
of the recent battle: There were 
grazes on her face and 
her robes were ripped. 
ÒMolly and Arthur are on their way,Ó she said, and the spell of 
the music was broken: Everyone rous
ed themselves as though com-
ing out of trances, turning again to 
look at Bill, or else to rub their 
own eyes, shake their heads. ÒHar
ry, what happened? According to 
Hagrid you were with Professo
r Dumbledore when he Ñ when it 
happened. He says Professor Sn
ape was involved in some ÑÓ 
ÒSnape killed Dumbledo
re,Ó said Harry. 
She stared at him for a mom
ent, then swayed alarmingly; 
Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to ha
ve pulled herself together, ran 
forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under 
McGonagall. 
ÒSnape,Ó repeated McGonagall fa
intly, falling into the chair. 
ÒWe all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . 
Snape
 . . . I 
canÕt believe it. . . .Ó ÒSnape was a highly accomplished
 Occlumens,Ó said Lupin, his 
voice uncharacteristically hars
h. ÒWe always knew that.Ó 
ÒBut Dumbledore swore he was on
 our side!Ó whispered Tonks. 
ÒI always thought Dumbledore mu
st know something about Snape 
that we didnÕt. . . .Ó 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 ./." ÒHe always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting 
Snape,Ó muttered Professor McGona
gall, now dabbing at the cor-
ners of her leaking eyes
 with a tartan-edged handkerchief. ÒI mean 
. . . with SnapeÕs histo
ry . . . of course people were bound to won-
der . . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that SnapeÕs repentance 
was absolutely genuine. . . . Woul
dnÕt hear a word against him!Ó 
ÒIÕd love to know what Snape to
ld him to convince him,Ó said 
Tonks. ÒI know,Ó said Harry, and they al
l turned to look at him. ÒSnape 
passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt 
down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadnÕt 
realized what he was doing, he 
was really sorry heÕd done it, sorry 
that they were dead.Ó 
They all stared at him. 
ÒAnd Dumbledore believed that?Ó said Lupin incredulously. 
ÒDumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape 
hated James. . . .Ó 
ÒAnd he didnÕt think my mother 
was worth a damn either,Ó said 
Harry, Òbecause she was Muggle-born. . . . ÔMudblood,Õ he called 
her. . . .Ó 
Nobody asked how Harry knew this
. All of them seemed to be 
lost in horrified shock, trying to 
digest the monstrous truth of what 
had happened. 
ÒThis is all my fault,Ó said Pr
ofessor McGonagall suddenly. She 
looked disoriented, twisting her 
wet handkerchief in her hands. 
ÒMy fault. I sent Filius to fetch 
Snape tonight, I actually sent for 
him to come and help us! If I hadn
Õt alerted Snape to what was go-
ing on, he might never have joined 
forces with the Death Eaters. I  
 &#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 ./8" donÕt think he knew they were ther
e before Filius to
ld him, I donÕt 
think he knew they
 were coming.Ó 
ÒIt isnÕt your fault, Minerva,Ó sa
id Lupin firmly. ÒWe all wanted 
more help, we were glad to thin
k Snape was on hi
s way. . . .Ó 
ÒSo when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death 
EatersÕ side?Ó asked Harry, who want
ed every detail of SnapeÕs du-
plicity and infamy, feverishly collec
ting more reasons to hate him, 
to swear vengeance. 
ÒI donÕt know exactly
 how it happened,Ó sa
id Professor McGona-
gall distractedly. ÒItÕs all so confu
sing. . . . Dumbledore had told us 
that he would be leaving the scho
ol for a few hours and that we 
were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and 
Nymphadora were to join us . . . 
and so we patrolled. All seemed 
quiet. Every secret passageway ou
t of the school was covered. We 
knew nobody could fly in. There 
were powerful enchantments on 
every entrance into the castle. I still donÕt know how the Death 
Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .Ó 
ÒI do,Ó said Harry, and he explai
ned, briefly, about the pair of 
Vanishing Cabinets and the magi
cal pathway they formed. ÒSo 
they got in through the 
Room of Requirement.Ó 
Almost against his will he glan
ced from Ron to Hermione, both 
of whom looked
 devastated. 
ÒI messed up, Harry,Ó said Ron blea
kly. ÒWe did like you told us: 
We checked the MarauderÕs Map and 
we couldnÕt see Malfoy on it, 
so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, 
Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it . . . but Malfoy got 
past us.Ó ÒHe came out of the room abou
t an hour after we started  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 ./9" keeping watch,Ó said Ginny. ÒHe wa
s on his own, clutching that 
awful shriveled arm ÑÓ 
ÒHis Hand of Glory,Ó said Ron. 
ÒGives light only to the holder, 
remember?Ó ÒAnyway,Ó Ginny went on, Òh
e must have been checking 
whether the coast was clear to let 
the Death Eaters out, because the 
moment he saw us he threw somet
hing into the air and it all went 
pitch-black ÑÓ 
ÒÑ Peruvian Instant Darkness Powd
er,Ó said Ron bitterly. ÒFred 
and GeorgeÕs. IÕm going to be havi
ng a word with them about who 
they let buy th
eir products.Ó 
ÒWe tried everything, Lumos, In
cendio,Ó said Ginny. ÒNothing 
would penetrate the darkness; all 
we could do was grope our way 
out of the corridor again, and me
anwhile we could hear people 
rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy 
could see because of that hand 
thing and was guiding them, but we 
didnÕt dare use any curses or 
anything in case we hit each other,
 and by the time weÕd reached a 
corridor that was li
ght, theyÕd gone.Ó 
ÒLuckily,Ó said Lupin hoarsely, ÒRon, Ginny, and Neville ran 
into us almost immediately and 
told us what had happened. We 
found the Death Eaters minutes late
r, heading in the direction of 
the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obvi
ously hadnÕt expected more peo-
ple to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of 
Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and 
we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up 
the tower stairs ÑÓ 
ÒTo set off the Mark?Ó asked Harry. 
ÒHe must have done, yes, they mu
st have arranged that before 
they left the Room of Requirement,Ó said Lupin. ÒBut I donÕt think 
&#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 ./:" Gibbon liked the idea of waitin
g up there alone for Dumbledore, 
because he came running back dow
nstairs to rejoin the fight and 
was hit by a Killing Curse 
that just missed me.Ó 
ÒSo if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny 
and Neville,Ó said Harry, turnin
g to Hermione, Òwere you Ñ ?Ó 
ÒOutside SnapeÕs office, yes,Ó whispered Hermione, her eyes 
sparkling with tears, Òwith Luna. 
We hung around for ages outside 
it and nothing happened. . . . We 
didnÕt know what was going on 
upstairs, Ron had taken the map. . . . It was nearly midnight when 
Professor Flitwick came sprinting 
down into the dungeons. He was 
shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I donÕt think he really 
registered that Luna and I were th
ere at all, he just burst his way 
into SnapeÕs office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go 
back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape 
came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and Ñ and ÑÓ 
ÒWhat?Ó Harry urged her. 
ÒI was so stupid, Harry!Ó said 
Hermione in a high-pitched whis-
per. ÒHe said Professor Flitwick 
had collapsed and that we should 
go and take care of him while he 
Ñ while he went to
 help fight the 
Death Eaters ÑÓ She covered her face in shame and continued to 
talk into her fingers, 
so that her voice was mu
ffled. ÒWe went into 
his office to see if we could help
 Professor Flitwick and found him 
unconscious on the floor . . . and 
oh, itÕs so obvious now, Snape 
must have Stupefied Flitwick, bu
t we didnÕt realize, Harry, we 
didnÕt realize, we 
just let Snape go!Ó 
ÒItÕs not your fault,Ó said Lupi
n firmly. ÒHermione, had you not 
obeyed Snape and got out of the 
way, he probably would have 
killed you and Luna.Ó 
ÒSo then he came upstairs,Ó sa
id Harry, who was watching Snape 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .4;" running up the marble staircase in
 his mindÕs eye, his black robes 
billowing behind him as
 ever, pulling his wa
nd from under his 
cloak as he ascended, Òand he fo
und the place where you were all 
fighting. . . .Ó 
ÒWe were in trouble, we were losing,Ó said Tonks in a low voice. 
ÒGibbon was down, but the rest of
 the Death Eaters seemed ready 
to fight to the death. Neville 
had been hurt, Bill had been savaged 
by Greyback . . . It was all dark . 
. . curses flying everywhere . . . 
The Malfoy boy had vanished, he 
must have slippe
d past, up the 
stairs . . . then more
 of them ran after him, but one of them 
blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville 
ran at it and got thrown
 up into the air ÑÓ 
ÒNone of us could break through,
Ó said Ron, Òand that massive 
Death Eater was still firing off jinx
es all over the place, they were 
bouncing off the walls and 
barely missing us. . . .Ó 
ÒAnd then Snape was there,Ó said Tonks, Òand then he wasnÕt ÑÓ 
ÒI saw him running toward us, bu
t that huge Death EaterÕs jinx 
just missed me right afterward an
d I ducked and lost track of 
things,Ó said Ginny. 
ÒI saw him run straight through th
e cursed barrier as though it 
wasnÕt there,Ó said Lupin. ÒI trie
d to follow him, but was thrown 
back just like 
Neville. . . .Ó 
ÒHe must have known a spell we
 didnÕt,Ó whispered McGona-
gall. ÒAfter all Ñ he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
. . . I just assumed that he was 
in a hurry to chase after the Death 
Eaters whoÕd escaped up 
to the tower. . . .Ó 
ÒHe was,Ó said Harry savagely, Òbut
 to help them, not to stop 
them . . . and IÕll bet you had to 
have a Dark Mark to get through 
that barrier Ñ so what happened when he came back down?Ó 
&#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 .4/" ÒWell, the big Death Eater had ju
st fired off a hex that caused 
half the ceiling to fall in, and 
also broke the curse blocking the 
stairs,Ó said Lupin. ÒWe all ran 
forward Ñ those of us who were 
still standing anyway Ñ and then Snape and the boy emerged out 
of the dust Ñ obviously, none
 of us attack
ed them ÑÓ 
ÒWe just let them pass,Ó said Tonks in a hollow voice. ÒWe 
thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters Ñ and next 
thing, the other Death Eaters and 
Greyback were back and we were 
fighting again Ñ I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I 
donÕt know what ÑÓ 
ÒHe shouted, ÔItÕs over,ÕÓ said Harry. ÒHeÕd done what heÕd 
meant to do.Ó 
They all fell silent. FawkesÕs lament was still echoing over the 
dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, un-
bidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into HarryÕs mind. . . . Had 
they taken DumbledoreÕs body from
 the foot of the tower yet? 
What would happen to it next? Wh
ere would it rest? He clenched 
his fists tightly in his pockets. He
 could feel the small cold lump of 
the fake Horcrux against the 
knuckles of his right hand. The doors of the hospital wing 
burst open, making them all 
jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were st
riding up the ward, Fleur just 
behind them, her beautiful face terrified. 
ÒMolly Ñ Arthur ÑÓ said Professor McGonagall, jumping up 
and hurrying to greet them. ÒI am so sorry ÑÓ 
ÒBill,Ó whispered Mrs. Weasley, 
darting past Professor McGona-
gall as she caught sight of
 BillÕs mangled face. ÒOh, 
Bill!Ó Lupin and Tonks had got up hast
ily and retreated so that Mr. 
and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent 
over her son and pressed her 
lips to his bloody forehead. 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .44" ÒYou said Greyback attacked him?Ó Mr. Weasley asked Professor 
McGonagall distractedly. ÒBut he hadnÕt transformed? So what 
does that mean? What wi
ll happen to Bill?Ó 
ÒWe donÕt yet know,Ó said Pro
fessor McGonagall, looking help-
lessly at Lupin. 
ÒThere will probably be some 
contamination, Arthur,Ó said 
Lupin. ÒIt is an odd case, possibly 
unique. . . . We donÕt know what 
his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . .Ó 
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-sm
elling ointment from Madam 
Pomfrey and began dabbing
 at BillÕs wounds. 
ÒAnd Dumbledore . . .Ó said Mr. Weasley. ÒMinerva, is it true 
. . . Is he really . . . ?Ó 
As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside 
him and looked at her. Her slight
ly narrowed eyes were fixed upon 
Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill
 with a frozen expression on her 
face. ÒDumbledore gone,Ó whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley 
had eyes only for her eldest son; sh
e began to sob, tears falling onto 
BillÕs mutilated face. 
ÒOf course, it doesnÕt matter how he
 looks. . . . ItÕs not r-really 
important . . . but he was a very ha
ndsome little b-boy . . . always 
very handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!Ó 
ÒAnd what do you mean by zat?Ó 
said Fleur suddenly and loudly. 
ÒWhat do you mean, ÔÕe was 
going
 to be married?ÕÓ 
Mrs. Weasley raised 
her tear-stained face, looking startled. 
ÒWell Ñ only that ÑÓ 
ÒYou theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?Ó demanded 
Fleur. ÒYou theenk, because of thes
e bites, he will not love me?Ó 
ÒNo, thatÕs not what I ÑÓ 
&#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 .45" ÒBecause Õe will!Ó said Fleur, draw
ing herself up to her full height 
and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. ÒIt would take 
more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!Ó 
ÒWell, yes, IÕm sure,Ó said Mr
s. Weasley, Òbut I thought per-
haps Ñ given how Ñ how he ÑÓ 
ÒYou thought I would not weesh 
to marry him? Or perÕaps, you 
hoped?Ó said Fleur, her nostrils 
flaring. ÒWhat do I care how he 
looks? I am good-looking enough fo
r both of us, I theenk! All these 
scars show is zat my husband is 
brave! And I shall do zat!Ó she 
added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weas
ley aside and snatching the oint-
ment from her. 
Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur 
mopping up BillÕs wounds with a 
most curious expression upon her 
face. Nobody said anything; Harr
y did not dare move. Like every-
body else, he was wait
ing for the explosion. 
ÒOur Great-Auntie Muriel,Ó said Mrs. Weasley after a long 
pause, Òhas a very beautiful ti
ara Ñ goblin-made Ñ which I am 
sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very 
fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.Ó 
ÒThank you,Ó said Fleur stiffly. ÒI
 am sure zat wi
ll be lovely.Ó 
And then, Harry did not quite 
see how it happened, both 
women were crying and hugging 
each other. Completely bewil-
dered, wondering whether the wo
rld had gone mad, he turned 
around: Ron looked as stunned as
 he felt and Ginny and Hermione 
were exchanging 
startled looks. 
ÒYou see!Ó said a strained voice. 
Tonks was glaring at Lupin. ÒShe 
still wants to marry him, even th
ough heÕs been bitten! She doesnÕt 
care!Ó 
ÒItÕs different,Ó said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .46" suddenly tense. ÒBill will not be a 
full werewolf. The cases are com-
pletely ÑÓ 
ÒBut I donÕt care either, I donÕt 
care!Ó said Tonks, seizing the 
front of LupinÕs robes and shaking them. ÒIÕve told you a million 
times. . . .Ó 
And the meaning of TonksÕs Patronus and her mouse-colored 
hair, and the reason she had co
me running to find Dumbledore 
when she had heard a rumor someo
ne had been attacked by Grey-
back, all suddenly became clear to 
Harry; it had not been Sirius 
that Tonks had fallen in
 love with after all. 
ÒAnd IÕve told 
you a million times,Ó said Lu
pin, refusing to meet 
her eyes, staring at the floor, Òtha
t I am too old for you, too poor 
. . . too dangerous. . . .Ó 
ÒIÕve said all along youÕre taking a ridiculous line on this, Re-
mus,Ó said Mrs. Weasley over FleurÕ
s shoulder as she patted her on 
the back. 
ÒI am not being ridiculous,Ó said Lupin steadily. ÒTonks deserves 
somebody young and whole.Ó 
ÒBut she wants you,Ó said Mr. Weas
ley, with a small smile. ÒAnd 
after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain 
so.Ó He gestured sadly at his 
son, lying between them. 
ÒThis is . . . not the moment to di
scuss it,Ó said Lupin, avoiding 
everybodyÕs eyes as he looked ar
ound distractedly. ÒDumbledore is 
dead. . . .Ó 
ÒDumbledore would have been ha
ppier than anybody to think 
that there was a little more love
 in the world,Ó said Professor 
McGonagall curtly, just as th
e hospital doors opened again and 
Hagrid walked in. 
&#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 .47" The little of his face that was no
t obscured by hair or beard was 
soaking and swollen; he was shak
ing with tears, a vast, spotted 
handkerchief in his hand. 
ÒIÕve . . . IÕve done it, Professor,Ó he choked. ÒM-moved him. 
Professor SproutÕs got the kids back 
in bed. Professor FlitwickÕs lyinÕ 
down, but he says heÕll be all righÕ 
in a jiffy, anÕ Professor Slughorn 
says the MinistryÕs bin informed.Ó 
ÒThank you, Hagrid,Ó said Prof
essor McGonagall, standing up 
at once and turning to 
look at the group around BillÕs bed. ÒI shall 
have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the 
Heads of Houses Ñ Slughorn ca
n represent Slytherin Ñ that I 
want to see them in my office fort
hwith. I would like you to join us 
too.Ó As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, 
she looked down at Harry. ÒBefor
e I meet them I would like a 
quick word with you, 
Harry. If youÕll co
me with me. . . .Ó 
Harry stood up, murmured ÒSee you in a bitÓ to Ron, Hermi-
one, and Ginny, and 
followed Professor Mc
Gonagall back down 
the ward. The corridors outside we
re deserted and the only sound 
was the distant phoenix song. It 
was several minutes before Harry 
became aware that they were no
t heading for Professor McGona-
gallÕs office, but for DumbledoreÕs,
 and another few seconds before 
he realized that of course, she ha
d been deputy headmistress. . . . 
Apparently she was now headmistre
ss . . . so the room behind the 
gargoyle was now hers. 
In silence they ascended the movi
ng spiral staircase and entered 
the circular office. He did not know
 what he had expected: that the 
room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumble-
doreÕs body might be lying there. In 
fact, it looked al
most exactly as 
!#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .4." it had done when he and Dumbledore 
had left it mere hours previ-
ously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle-
legged tables, GryffindorÕs sword in
 its glass case 
gleaming in the 
moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk. But 
FawkesÕs perch stood empty, he was 
still crying his lament to the 
grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead head-
masters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slum-
bering in a golden frame over th
e desk, his half-moon spectacles 
perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled. 
After glancing once at this port
rait, Professor McGonagall made 
an odd movement as th
ough steeling hersel
f, then rounded the 
desk to look at Harry, 
her face taut and lined. 
ÒHarry,Ó she said, ÒI would like to know what you and Professor 
Dumbledore were doing 
this evening when you left the school.Ó 
ÒI canÕt tell you that, 
Professor,Ó said Harry. He had expected the 
question and had his answer ready.
 It had been here, in this very 
room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the 
contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione. 
ÒHarry, it might be important,
Ó said Professor McGonagall. 
ÒIt is,Ó said Harry, Òv
ery, but he didnÕt want me to tell anyone.Ó 
Professor McGonagall glared at
 him. ÒPotterÓ Ñ Harry regis-
tered the renewed use of his surn
ame Ñ Òin the light of Professor 
DumbledoreÕs death, I think you must see that the situation has 
changed somewhat ÑÓ 
ÒI donÕt think so,Ó said Harry, shrugging. ÒProfessor Dumble-
dore never told me to 
stop following his or
ders if he died.Ó 
ÒBut ÑÓ 
ÒThereÕs one thing you should kn
ow before the Ministry gets  
 &#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 .48" here, though. Madam RosmertaÕs 
under the Imperius Curse, she 
was helping Malfoy and the Death 
Eaters, thatÕs how the necklace 
and the poisoned mead ÑÓ 
ÒRosmerta?Ó said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but be-
fore she could go on, there was 
a knock on the door behind them 
and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, 
and Slughorn traipsed into the 
room, followed by Hagrid, who wa
s still weeping copiously, his 
huge frame trembling with grief. 
ÒSnape!Ó ejaculated Slughorn, wh
o looked the most shaken, pale 
and sweating. ÒSnape! I taught
 him! I thought I knew him!Ó 
But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice 
spoke from high on the wall: A sa
llow-faced wizard with a short 
black fringe had just walked 
back into his empty canvas. 
ÒMinerva, the Minister will be he
re within seconds, he has just 
Disapparated from the Ministry.Ó 
ÒThank you, Everard,Ó said 
Professor McGonagall, and she 
turned quickly to
 her teachers. 
ÒI want to talk about what happ
ens to Hogwarts before he gets 
here,Ó she said quickly. ÒPersonally, I am not convinced that the 
school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the 
hands of one of our colleagues is 
a terrible stain upon HogwartsÕs 
history. It is horrible.Ó 
ÒI am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to re-
main open,Ó said Professor Sprout. 
ÒI feel that if a single pupil 
wants to come, then the school 
ought to remain open for that 
pupil.Ó 
ÒBut will we have a single pupil 
after this?Ó said Slughorn, now 
dabbing his sweating brow with a si
lken handkerchief. ÒParents will  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .49" want to keep their children at ho
me and I canÕt sa
y I blame them. 
Personally, I donÕt think weÕre in mo
re danger at Hogwarts than we 
are anywhere else, but you canÕt expect mothers to think like that. 
TheyÕll want to keep 
their families together
, itÕs only natural.Ó 
ÒI agree,Ó said Professor McGonaga
ll. ÒAnd in any case, it is not 
true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which 
Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he 
considered the closure of the sc
hool Ñ and I must say that Pro-
fessor DumbledoreÕs
 murder is more distur
bing to me than the 
idea of SlytherinÕs monster living undetected in the bowels of the 
castle. . . .Ó 
ÒWe must consult the governors,Ó 
said Professor Flitwick in his 
squeaky little voice; he had a la
rge bruise on his forehead but 
seemed otherwise unscathed by his 
collapse in SnapeÕs office. ÒWe 
must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be 
made hastily.Ó 
ÒHagrid, you havenÕt said anything,Ó said Professor McGonagall. 
ÒWhat are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?Ó 
Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted 
handkerchief throughout this conv
ersation, now raised puffy red 
eyes and croaked, ÒI dunno, Profe
ssor . . . thatÕs fer the Heads of 
House anÕ the headmistre
ss ter decide . . .Ó ÒProfessor Dumbledore always valu
ed your views,Ó said Profes-
sor McGonagall kind
ly, Òand so do I.Ó 
ÒWell, IÕm stayinÕ,Ó said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the 
corners of his eyes and trickling 
down into his tangled beard. ÒItÕs 
me home, itÕs bin me home sinc
e I was thirteen. AnÕ if thereÕs 
kids who wanÕ me ter teach Õem, IÕ
ll do it. But . . . I dunno . . .  
 &#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 .4:" Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . 
.Ó He gulped and disappeared 
behind his handkerchief once mo
re, and there was silence. 
ÒVery well,Ó said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the win-
dow at the grounds, checking to 
see whether the Minister was yet 
approaching, Òthen I must agree with Filius that the right thing to 
do is to consult the go
vernors, who wi
ll make the fi
nal decision. 
ÒNow, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for 
doing it sooner rather than late
r. We could arrange for the Hog-
warts Express to come to
morrow if necessary ÑÓ 
ÒWhat about DumbledoreÕs funera
l?Ó said Harry, speaking at 
last. ÒWell . . .Ó said Professor McGo
nagall, losing a little of her 
briskness as her voice 
shook. ÒI Ñ I know 
that it was Dumble-
doreÕs wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts ÑÓ 
ÒThen thatÕs whatÕll happen, is
nÕt it?Ó said Harry fiercely. 
ÒIf the Ministry thinks
 it appropriate,Ó said Professor McGona-
gall. ÒNo other headmaster or 
headmistress has ever been ÑÓ 
ÒNo other headmaster or headmist
ress ever gave more to this 
school,Ó growled Hagrid. 
ÒHogwarts should be DumbledoreÕ
s final resting place,Ó said 
Professor Flitwick. 
ÒAbsolutely,Ó said Professor Sprout. 
ÒAnd in that case,Ó said Harry, Òyou shouldnÕt send the students 
home until the funeralÕs over
. TheyÕll want to say ÑÓ 
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout com-
pleted the sentence for him. 
ÒGood-bye.Ó ÒWell said,Ó squeaked Professor Fl
itwick. ÒWell said indeed! Our  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .5;" students should pay tribute, it is
 fitting. We can arrange transport 
home afterward.Ó 
ÒSeconded,Ó barked Professor Sprout. 
ÒI suppose . . . yes . . .Ó said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, 
while Hagrid let out a st
rangled sob of assent. 
ÒHeÕs coming,Ó said Professor 
McGonagall suddenly, gazing 
down into the grounds. ÒThe Minist
er . . . and by the looks of it, 
heÕs brought a de
legation . . .Ó 
ÒCan I leave, Professor?
Ó said Harry at once. 
He had no desire at all to see,
 or be interrogated by, Rufus 
Scrimgeour tonight. 
ÒYou may,Ó said Professor 
McGonagall. ÒAnd quickly.Ó 
She strode toward the door and he
ld it open for him. He sped 
down the spiral staircase and off 
along the deserted corridor; he 
had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, 
but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him 
pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, 
or Peeves. He did not meet an-
other soul until he turned into 
the passage leadin
g to the Gryffin-
dor common room. 
ÒIs it true?Ó whispered the Fat Lady
 as he approached her. ÒIt is 
really true? Dumb
ledore Ñ dead?Ó 
ÒYes,Ó said Harry. 
She let out a wail and, without 
waiting for the password, swung 
forward to admit him. 
As Harry had suspec
ted it would be, th
e common room was 
jam-packed. The room fell silent 
as he climbed through the por-
trait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This 
meant that the dormitory must be 
empty, or nearly so. Without  
 &#'""%#0'*-1""2$3'*&"
 .5/" speaking to anybody, without maki
ng eye contact at all, Harry 
walked straight across the room 
and through the door to the boysÕ 
dormitories. As he had hoped, Ron was waiting 
for him, still fully dressed, sit-
ting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a 
moment, they simply stared at each other. 
ÒTheyÕre talking about closin
g the school,Ó said Harry. 
ÒLupin said they would,Ó said Ron. 
There was a pause. 
ÒSo?Ó said Ron in a very low voice,
 as though he thought the fur-
niture might be listening in. ÒDid you find one? Did you get it? 
A Ñ a Horcrux?Ó 
Harry shook his head. All that had 
taken place around that black 
lake seemed like an old nightmar
e now; had it really happened, and 
only hours ago? 
ÒYou didnÕt get it?Ó said Ron, 
looking crestfallen. ÒIt wasnÕt 
there?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry. ÒSomeone had alre
ady taken it and left a fake 
in its place.Ó 
ÒAlready 
taken
 Ñ ?Ó 
Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, 
opened it, and passed it
 to Ron. The full sto
ry could wait. . . . It 
did not matter tonight . . . nothing mattered except the end, the 
end of their pointless adventure, 
the end of Dumble
doreÕs life. . . . ÒR.A.B.,Ó whispered Ron,
 Òbut who was that?Ó 
ÒDunno,Ó said Harry, lying back
 on his bed fully clothed and 
staring blankly upwards. He felt 
no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: 
He doubted that he would ever feel 
curious again. As he lay there,  
 !#$%&'(""&)'*&+,*-*'"
 .54" he became aware suddenly that 
the grounds were silent. Fawkes 
had stopped singing. 
And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the 
phoenix had gone, had left Hogwar
ts for good, just as Dumbledore 
had left the school, had left th
e world . . . ha
d left Harry. 
!"#"$"%"&"'"(""&"#")"("&"*"
""+,," &#'"-#)&'"&./0"
   ll lessons were suspended, 
all examinations postponed. 
Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by 
their parents over the 
next couple of days Ñ the Patil twins were 
gone before breakfast on the 
morning following DumbledoreÕs 
death, and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his 
haughty-looking father. Seamus Fi
nnigan, on the other hand, re-
fused point-blank to accompany 
his mother home; they had a 
shouting match in the entrance 
hall that was resolved when she 
agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had diffi-
culty in finding a bed in Hogsmead
e, Seamus told Harry and Ron, 
for wizards and witches were pourin
g into the village, preparing to 
pay their last respec
ts to Dumbledore. 
Some excitement was caused am
ong the younger students, who 
had never seen it before, when a po
wder-blue carriage the size of a 
house, pulled by a dozen giant wing
ed palominos, came soaring out 
of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the 
$"!#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +,1" edge of the forest. Harry watched 
from a window as a gigantic and 
handsome olive-skinned, black-
haired woman descended the car-
riage steps and threw herself into the waiting HagridÕs arms. Mean-
while a delegation of Ministry offi
cials, including the Minister of 
Magic himself, was being accomm
odated within the castle. Harry 
was diligently avoiding contact with
 any of them; he was sure that, 
sooner or later, he would be as
ked again to account for Dumble-
doreÕs last excursion from Hogwarts. 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all of their 
time together. The beautiful weat
her seemed to mock them; Harry 
could imagine how it would have
 been if Dumbledore had not 
died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the 
year, GinnyÕs examinations finish
ed, the pressure of homework 
lifted . . . and hour by hour, he 
put off saying the thing that he 
knew he must say, doing what he 
knew was right to do, because it 
was too hard to forgo his 
best source of comfort. 
They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been dis-
charged, but Bill remained unde
r Madam PomfreyÕs care. His scars 
were as bad as ever Ñ in truth, 
he now bore a dist
inct resemblance 
to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs Ñ 
but in personality he seemed just
 the same as ever. All that ap-
peared to have changed was that 
he now had a great liking for very 
rare steaks. 
Ò. . . so eet ees lucky Õe is marrying me,Ó said Fleur happily, 
plumping up BillÕs pillows, Òbecause
 ze British overcook their meat, 
I Õave always said this.Ó 
ÒI suppose IÕm just going to have to accept that he really is going 
to marry her,Ó sighed Gi
nny later that evening, 
as she, Harry, Ron,  
 &#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +,2" and Hermione sat beside the open 
window of the Gryffindor com-
mon room, looking out over the twilit grounds. 
ÒSheÕs not that bad,Ó said Harry. ÒUgly, though,Ó he added 
hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant 
giggle. 
ÒWell, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.Ó 
ÒAnyone else we know died?Ó 
Ron asked Hermione, who was pe-
rusing the 
Evening Prophet.
 Hermione winced at the forced 
toughness in his voice. ÒNo,Ó 
she said reprovingly, folding up 
the newspaper. ÒTheyÕre still look-
ing for Snape but no sign . . .Ó 
ÒOf course there isnÕt,Ó said Ha
rry, who became angry every time 
this subject cropped up. ÒThey wo
nÕt find Snape till they find 
Voldemort, and seeing as theyÕve never managed to do that in all 
this time . . .Ó ÒIÕm going to go to bed,Ó yaw
ned Ginny. ÒI havenÕt been sleep-
ing that well since . 
. . well . . . I could 
do with some sleep.Ó 
She kissed Harry (Ron looked aw
ay pointedly), waved at the 
other two, and departed for the gi
rlsÕ dormitories. The moment the 
door had closed behind her, He
rmione leaned forward toward 
Harry with a most Hermione
-ish look on her face. 
ÒHarry, I found something out th
is morning, in the library.Ó 
ÒR.A.B.?Ó said Harry, 
sitting up straight. 
He did not feel the way 
he had so often felt 
before, excited, curi-
ous, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew 
that the task of discovering the tr
uth about the real Horcrux had to 
be completed before he could move
 a little farther along the dark 
and winding path stretching ahead 
of him, the path
 that he and  
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +,+" Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew 
he would have to journey alone. 
There might still be as many as 
four Horcruxes out there somewher
e, and each would need to be 
found and eliminated before there 
was even a possibili
ty that Volde-
mort could be killed. He kept re
citing their names to himself, as 
though by listing them he co
uld bring them within reach: 
the locket 
. . .
 the cup
 . . . 
the snake
 . . . 
something of GryffindorÕs or RavenclawÕs 
. . . 
the locket
 . . . 
the cup
 . . . 
the snake
 . . . 
something of GryffindorÕs 
or RavenclawÕs
 . . . 
This mantra seemed to pulse th
rough HarryÕs mind as he fell 
asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and 
mysterious objects that he could 
not quite reach, though Dumble-
dore helpfully offered Harry a rope la
dder that turned to snakes the 
moment he began to climb. . . . 
He had shown Hermione the note 
inside the locket the morning 
after DumbledoreÕs death, and al
though she had not immediately 
recognized the initials as belong
ing to some obscure wizard about 
whom she had been reading, she ha
d since been rushing off to the 
library a little more often than wa
s strictly necessary for somebody 
who had no homework to do. 
ÒNo,Ó she said sadly, ÒIÕve be
en trying, Harry, but I havenÕt 
found anything. . . . There are a 
couple of reasonably well-known 
wizards with those initials Ñ Rosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert 
ÔAxebangerÕ Brookstanton . . . but th
ey donÕt seem to fit at all. 
Judging by that note, the pers
on who stole the Horcrux knew 
Voldemort, and I canÕt find a shre
d of evidence that Bungs or Axe-
banger ever had anything to do wi
th him. . . . No, actually, itÕs 
about . . . well, Snape.Ó 
She looked nervous even 
saying the name again. 
&#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +,3" ÒWhat about him?Ó asked Harry heav
ily, slumping back in his 
chair. ÒWell, itÕs just that I was so
rt of right about the Half-Blood 
Prince business,Ó she said tentatively. 
ÒDÕyou have to rub it in, He
rmione? How dÕyou think I feel 
about that now?Ó 
ÒNo Ñ no Ñ Harry, I didnÕt mean 
that!Ó she said hastily, look-
ing around to check that
 they were not being overheard. ÒItÕs just 
that I was right about Eileen Prince
 once owning the book. You see 
. . . she was SnapeÕs mother!Ó ÒI thought she wasnÕt much of a 
looker,Ó said Ron. Hermione ig-
nored him. 
ÒI was going through the rest of the old 
Prophets 
and there was a 
tiny announcement about Eileen
 Prince marrying a man called 
Tobias Snape, and then later an 
announcement saying that sheÕd 
given birth to a ÑÓ 
ÒÑ murderer,Ó spat Harry. 
ÒWell . . . yes,Ó said Hermione. ÒSo . . . I was sort of right. 
Snape must have been proud of being Ôhalf a Prince,Õ you see? 
Tobias Snape was a Muggle fr
om what it said in the 
Prophet.
Ó ÒYeah, that fits,Ó said Harry. ÒH
eÕd play up the pure-blood side 
so he could get in with Lucius Ma
lfoy and the rest of them. . . . 
HeÕs just like Voldemort. Pure-b
lood mother, Muggle father . . . 
ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the 
Dark Arts, gave himself an
 impressive new name Ñ 
Lord Volde-
mort Ñ the Half-Blood 
Prince Ñ how could Dumbledore have 
missed Ñ ?Ó 
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop him-
self dwelling upon DumbledoreÕs 
inexcusable trust in Snape . . . 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +,4" but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, 
had been taken in just the same. . . 
. In spite of the increasing nas-
tiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the 
boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much. . . . 
Helped him 
. . . it was an almost 
unendurable thought now. 
ÒI still donÕt get why he didnÕt tu
rn you in for using that book,Ó 
said Ron. ÒHe mustÕve known where 
you were getting it all from.Ó 
ÒHe knew,Ó said Harry bitterly.
 ÒHe knew when I used Sectum-
sempra. He didnÕt really need Legi
limency. . . . He might even have 
known before then, with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I 
was at Potions. . . . ShouldnÕt have
 left his old book in the bottom 
of that cupboard, should he?Ó 
ÒBut why didnÕt he turn you in?Ó 
ÒI donÕt think he wanted to asso
ciate himself with that book,Ó 
said Hermione. ÒI donÕt think 
Dumbledore would have liked it 
very much if heÕd known. And even if Snape pretended it hadnÕt 
been his, Slughorn would have re
cognized his writing at once. 
Anyway, the book was left in Sn
apeÕs old classroom, and IÕll bet 
Dumbledore knew his mother was called ÔPrince.ÕÓ 
ÒI shouldÕve shown the book to Dumbledore,Ó said Harry. ÒAll 
that time he was show
ing me how Voldemort was evil even when 
he was at school, and I ha
d proof Snape 
was too ÑÓ 
ÒÔEvilÕ is a strong word,Ó said Hermione quietly. 
ÒYou were the one who kept 
telling me the 
book was dan-
gerous!Ó 
ÒIÕm trying to say, Ha
rry, that youÕre putt
ing too much blame on 
yourself. I thought the Prince seem
ed to have a nasty sense of hu-
mor, but I would never have guessed 
he was a potential killer. . . .Ó 
 &#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +,5" ÒNone of us couldÕve guessed Sn
ape would . . . you know,Ó said 
Ron. Silence fell between them, each 
of them lost in their own 
thoughts, but Harry was sure that 
they, like him, were thinking 
about the following morning, when DumbledoreÕs body would be 
laid to rest. He had never attended
 a funeral before; there had been 
no body to bury when Sirius had di
ed. He did not know what to ex-
pect and was a little worried about 
what he might see, about how he 
would feel. He wondered whether DumbledoreÕs death would be 
more real to him once it was over. Though he had moments when 
the horrible fact of it
 threatened to overwhelm him, there were 
blank stretches of numbness where,
 despite the fact that nobody 
was talking about anything
 else in the whole castle, he still found it 
difficult to believe that Dumbledor
e had really gone. Admittedly he 
had not, as he had with Sirius, lo
oked desperately for some kind of 
loophole, some way that Dumble
dore would come back. . . . He 
felt in his pocket for the cold chai
n of the fake Horcrux, which he 
now carried with him everywhere, 
not as a talisman, but as a re-
minder of what it had cost an
d what remained still to do. 
Harry rose early to pack the ne
xt day; the Hogwarts Express 
would be leaving an hour after 
the funeral. Downstairs, he found 
the mood in the Great Hall subdue
d. Everybody was wearing their 
dress robes and no one seemed ve
ry hungry. Professor McGonagall 
had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. 
HagridÕs chair was deserted too; 
Harry thought that perhaps he had 
not been able to face breakfast, 
but SnapeÕs place had been uncere-
moniously filled by Rufus Scrimge
our. Harry avoided his yellowish 
eyes as they scanned the Hall; Ha
rry had the uncomfortable feeling  
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +16" that Scrimgeour was looking fo
r him. Among ScrimgeourÕs en-
tourage Harry spotted the red hair
 and horn-rimmed glasses of 
Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart 
from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom. 
Over at the Slytherin table Cr
abbe and Goyle were muttering 
together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely 
without the tall, pale figure of 
Malfoy between them, bossing them 
around. Harry had not spared Malf
oy much thought. His animos-
ity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in MalfoyÕs 
voice on that tower top, nor the fa
ct that he had lowered his wand 
before the other Death 
Eaters arrived. Harry 
did not believe that 
Malfoy would have killed Dumble
dore. He despised Malfoy still 
for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of 
pity mingled with his dislike. 
Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy 
now, and what was Voldemort ma
king him do under threat of 
killing him and 
his parents? 
HarryÕs thoughts were interrupted 
by a nudge in the ribs from 
Ginny. Professor McGonagall had ri
sen to her feet, and the mourn-
ful hum in the Hall 
died away at once. 
ÒIt is nearly time,Ó she said. ÒPle
ase follow your Heads of Houses 
out into the grounds. G
ryffindors, after me.Ó 
They filed out from behind thei
r benches in near silence. Harry 
glimpsed Slughorn at the head 
of the Slytherin column, wearing 
magnificent, long, emerald green robes embroidered with silver. 
He had never seen Professor Sprout
, Head of the Hufflepuffs, look-
ing so clean; there was not a single
 patch on her hat, and when they 
reached the entrance hall, they 
found Madam Pince standing be-
side Filch, she in a thick black veil
 that fell to her knees, he in an 
ancient black suit and ti
e reeking of mothballs. 
&#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +17" They were heading, as Harry sa
w when he stepped out onto the 
stone steps from the front doors, 
toward the lake. The warmth of 
the sun caressed his face as they
 followed Professor McGonagall in 
silence to the place where hundreds
 of chairs had been set out in 
rows. An aisle ran down the center
 of them: There was a marble 
table standing at the front, all chai
rs facing it. It was the most beau-
tiful summerÕs day. 
An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into 
half of the chairs; shabby and sm
art, old and young. Most Harry 
did not recognize, but a few he di
d, including members of the Or-
der of the Phoenix: Kingsley Sh
acklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, 
her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, 
with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, 
who were wearing jackets of bl
ack dragon skin. Then there was 
Madame Maxime, who took up two 
and a half chairs on her own; 
Tom, the landlord of the Leaky 
Cauldron in Lo
ndon; Arabella 
Figg, HarryÕs Squib neighbor; the 
hairy bass player from the Wiz-
arding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight 
Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe sh
op in Diagon Alley; and some 
people whom Harry merely knew by 
sight, such as the barman of 
the HogÕs Head and the witch who 
pushed the trolley on the Hog-
warts Express. The castle ghosts were
 there too, barely visible in the 
bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering in-
substantially on the gleaming air. 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny fi
led into seats at the end of a 
row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it 
sounded like a breeze in the grass,
 but the birdsong was louder by 
far. The crowd continue
d to swell; with a great rush of affection 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +18" for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by 
Luna. Neville and Luna alone of the D.A. had responded to Her-
mioneÕs summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry 
knew why: They were the ones wh
o had missed the D.A. most . . . 
probably the ones who had checke
d their coins regularly in the 
hope that there would be another meeting. 
Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expres-
sion miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next 
recognized Rita Skeeter, who, he 
was infuriated to see, had a note-
book clutched in her red-taloned 
hand, and then, with a worse jolt 
of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an un
convincing expression of grief 
upon her toadlike face, a black velv
et bow set atop her iron-colored 
curls. At the sight of 
the centaur Firenze, wh
o was standing like a 
sentinel near the waterÕs edge, she 
gave a start and scurried hastily 
into a seat a g
ood distance away. 
The staff was seated at last. Ha
rry could see Scrimgeour looking 
grave and dignified in
 the front row with 
Professor McGonagall. 
He wondered whether Scrimgeour 
or any of these important peo-
ple were really sorry that Dumbledo
re was dead. But then he heard 
music, strange, otherworldly music,
 and he forgot his dislike of the 
Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the 
only one: Many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed. 
ÒIn there,Ó whispered Gi
nny in HarryÕs ear. 
And he saw them in the clear gree
n sunlit water, inches below the 
surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi: a chorus of mer-
people singing in a strange langua
ge he did not understand, their 
pallid faces rippling, their purpli
sh hair flowing all around them. 
The music made the hair on HarryÕs neck stand up, and yet it was 
not unpleasant. It spoke very clearl
y of loss and of despair. As he 
&#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +1," looked down into the wild faces of
 the singers, he had the feeling 
that they, at least, were sorry for DumbledoreÕs passing. Then 
Ginny nudged him again and he looked around. 
Hagrid was walking slowly up 
the aisle between the chairs. He 
was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his 
arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was 
what Harry knew to be Dumbledor
eÕs body. A sharp pain rose in 
HarryÕs throat at this sight: Fo
r a moment, the strange music and 
the knowledge that DumbledoreÕs body
 was so close seemed to take 
all warmth from the 
day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears 
were falling thick and fast into both GinnyÕs and HermioneÕs laps. 
They could not see clearly what 
was happening at the front. Ha-
grid seemed to have placed the b
ody carefully upon the table. Now 
he retreated down the aisle, blowin
g his nose with loud trumpeting 
noises that drew scandalized lo
oks from some, including, Harry 
saw, Dolores Umbridge . . . 
but Harry knew that Dumbledore 
would not have cared. 
He tried to make a fr
iendly gesture to Ha-
grid as he passed, but HagridÕs eyes were so swollen it was a wonder 
he could see where he was going. 
Harry glanced at the back row to 
which Hagrid was heading and real
ized what was guiding him, for 
there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar-
quee, was the giant Grawp, his grea
t ugly boulderlike head bowed, 
docile, almost human. Hagrid sa
t down next to his half-brother, 
and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on th
e head, so that 
his chair legs 
sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to 
laugh. But then the music stopped, 
and he turned to face the front 
again. A little tufty-haired man in plai
n black robes had got to his feet 
and stood now in front of Dumb
ledoreÕs body. Harry could not 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +11" hear what he was saying. Odd word
s floated back to
 them over the 
hundreds of heads. ÒNobility of sp
iritÓ . . . Òintellectual contribu-
tionÓ . . . Ògreatness of heartÓ . . . 
It did not mean very much. It had 
little to do with Dumbledore 
as Harry had known him. He sud-
denly remembered DumbledoreÕs id
ea of a few words, Ònitwit,Ó 
Òoddment,Ó Òblubber,Ó and Òtweak
,Ó and again had to suppress a 
grin. . . . What was 
the matter with him? 
There was a soft splashing noise to
 his left and he saw that the 
merpeople had broken the surface 
to listen too. He remembered 
Dumbledore crouching at the waterÕ
s edge two years ago, very close 
to where Harry now sat, and conver
sing in Mermish with the Mer-
chieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned 
Mermish. There was so much he ha
d never asked him, so much he 
should have said. . . . 
And then, without warning, it 
swept over him, the dreadful 
truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. 
Dumbledore was dead, gone. . . . He clutched the cold locket in 
his hand so tightly that
 it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears 
spilling from his eyes: He looked
 away from Ginny and the others 
and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the little man in 
black droned on. . . . There wa
s movement among the trees. The 
centaurs had come to pay their re
spects too. They did not move 
into the open but Harry saw them st
anding quite still, half hidden 
in shadow, watching the wizards, th
eir bows hanging at their sides. 
And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest, 
the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then 
Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumble-
dore had discussed fighting a losing 
battle not long thereafter. It  
 &#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +12" was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and 
keep fighting, for only 
then could evil be kept at bay, though never 
quite eradicated. . . . 
And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how 
people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, 
his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all 
determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let 
anybody else stand between him an
d Voldemort; he must abandon 
forever the illusion he ought to have
 lost at the age of one, that the 
shelter of a parentÕs arms mean
t that nothing could hurt him. 
There was no waking from his ni
ghtmare, no comforting whisper 
in the dark that he was safe really, 
that it was all in his imagination; 
the last and greatest of his prot
ectors had died, and he was more 
alone than he had ever been before. 
The little man in black had stop
ped speaking at
 last and re-
sumed his seat. Harry waited for some
body else to get to their feet; 
he expected speeches, probably 
from the Minister, but nobody 
moved. 
Then several people screamed. Br
ight, white flames had erupted 
around DumbledoreÕs body and the table upon which it lay: 
Higher and higher they rose, ob
scuring the body. White smoke 
spiraled into the air and made 
strange shapes: Harry thought, for 
one heart-stopping moment, that he
 saw a phoenix fly joyfully into 
the blue, but next second the fire 
had vanished. In its place was a 
white marble tomb, encasing Dumb
ledoreÕs body and the table on 
which he had rested. 
There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows 
soared through the air, but they fell 
far short of the crowd. It was,  
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +1+" Harry knew, the centaursÕ tribute: 
He saw them turn tail and dis-
appear back into the cool trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank 
slowly back into the green wa
ter and were lost from view. 
Harry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: RonÕs face was 
screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him. HermioneÕs 
face was glazed with tears, but 
Ginny was no longer crying. She 
met HarryÕs gaze with the same hard
, blazing look that he had seen 
when she had hugged him after wi
nning the Quidditch Cup in his 
absence, and he knew that at th
at moment they understood each 
other perfectly, and that when he 
told her what he was going to do 
now, she would not say, ÒBe carefu
l,Ó or ÒDonÕt do it,Ó but accept 
his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of 
him. And so he steeled himself to 
say what he had known he must 
say ever since Dumbledore had died. 
ÒGinny, listen . . .Ó he said very 
quietly, as the buzz of conversa-
tion grew louder around them and 
people began to get to their feet, 
ÒI canÕt be involved with you an
ymore. WeÕve got to stop seeing 
each other. We ca
nÕt be together.Ó 
She said, with an oddly twisted sm
ile, ÒItÕs for some stupid, no-
ble reason, isnÕt it?Ó 
ÒItÕs been like . . . like something 
out of someone elseÕs life, these 
last few weeks with you,Ó said Harry.
 ÒBut I canÕt . . . we canÕt . . . 
IÕve got things to do alone now.Ó 
She did not cry, she simply looked at him. 
ÒVoldemort uses people his enemies are close to. HeÕs already 
used you as bait once, and that 
was just because youÕre my best 
friendÕs sister. Think how much danger
 youÕll be in if we keep this 
up. HeÕll know, heÕll find out. HeÕll try and get to me through you.Ó 
ÒWhat if I donÕt care?Ó
 said Ginny fiercely. 
&#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +13" ÒI care,Ó said Harry. ÒHow do you 
think IÕd feel if this was your 
funeral . . . and it wa
s my fault. . . .Ó 
She looked away from 
him, over the lake. 
ÒI never really gave 
up on you,Ó she said. ÒNot really. I always 
hoped. . . . Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out 
with some other people, relax a 
bit around you, because I never 
used to be able to talk if you 
were in the room, remember? And she 
thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more Ñ 
myself.Ó 
ÒSmart girl, that Hermione,Ó said 
Harry, trying to smile. ÒI just 
wish IÕd asked you sooner. We coul
dÕve had ages . . . months . . . 
years maybe. . . .Ó 
ÒBut youÕve been too busy saving the Wizarding world,Ó said 
Ginny, half laughing. ÒWell . . . I 
canÕt say IÕm surprised. I knew 
this would happen in 
the end. I knew you wo
uldnÕt be happy un-
less you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe thatÕs why I like you so 
much.Ó 
Harry could not bear to hear thes
e things, nor did he think his 
resolution would hold if he remai
ned sitting beside her. Ron, he 
saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she 
sobbed into his shoulder, tears dr
ipping from the end of his own 
long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back 
on Ginny and on DumbledoreÕs 
tomb, and walked away around 
the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still, just as 
setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill 
Voldemort would feel
 better than waitin
g to do it. . . . 
ÒHarry!Ó He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour wa
s limping rapidly toward him 
around the bank, leaning 
on his walking stick. 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +14" ÒIÕve been hoping to ha
ve a word . . . do you 
mind if I walk a lit-
tle way with you?Ó 
ÒNo,Ó said Harry indifferen
tly, and set off again. 
ÒHarry, this was a dreadful tragedy,Ó said Scrimgeour quietly. ÒI 
cannot tell you how ap
palled I was to hear 
of it. Dumbledore was 
a very great wizard. We had our 
disagreements, as you know, but 
no one knows better than I ÑÓ 
ÒWhat do you want?Ó 
asked Harry flatly. 
Scrimgeour looked annoyed, but 
as before, hastily modified his 
expression to one of so
rrowful understanding. 
ÒYou are, of course, devastated,Ó he said. ÒI know that you were 
very close to Dumbledore. I think 
you may have been his favorite 
pupil ever. The bond between the two of you ÑÓ 
ÒWhat do you want?Ó Harry re
peated, coming to a halt. 
Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on
 his stick, and stared at Harry, 
his expression shrewd now. 
ÒThe word is that you were with him when he left the school the 
night that he died.Ó 
ÒWhose word?Ó said Harry. 
ÒSomebody Stupefied a Death Eate
r on top of the tower after 
Dumbledore died. There were also 
two broomsticks up there. The 
Ministry can add two and two, Harry.Ó 
ÒGlad to hear it,Ó said Harry. ÒWell, where I went with Dum-
bledore and what we did is my busi
ness. He didnÕt want people to 
know.Ó 
ÒSuch loyalty is admirable, of 
course,Ó said Scrimgeour, who 
seemed to be restraining his irri
tation with diffi
culty, Òbut Dum-
bledore is gone, Ha
rry. HeÕs gone.Ó 
 &#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +15" ÒHe will only be gone from th
e school when none here are loyal 
to him,Ó said Harry, smil
ing in spite of himself. 
ÒMy dear boy . . . even Dumbledo
re cannot return from the ÑÓ 
ÒI am not saying he can. You wouldnÕt understand. But IÕve got 
nothing to tell you.Ó 
Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, 
in what was evidently supposed 
to be a tone of delicacy, ÒThe 
Ministry can offer you all sorts of 
protection, you know, Harry. I wo
uld be delighted to place a cou-
ple of my Aurors at your service ÑÓ 
Harry laughed. ÒVoldemort wants to
 kill me himself, and Aurors 
wonÕt stop him. So thanks fo
r the offer, but no thanks.Ó 
ÒSo,Ó said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, Òthe request I made of 
you at Christmas ÑÓ 
ÒWhat request? Oh yeah . . . the 
one where I tell the world what 
a great job youÕre doing in exchange for ÑÓ 
ÒÑ for raising eve
ryoneÕs morale!Ó snapped Scrimgeour. 
Harry considered 
him for a moment. 
ÒReleased Stan Shunpike yet?Ó 
Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple
 color highly reminiscent of 
Uncle Vernon. 
ÒI see you are ÑÓ 
ÒDumbledoreÕs man through and 
through,Ó said Harry. ÒThatÕs 
right.Ó Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and 
limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the 
rest of the Ministry delegation 
waiting for him, casting nervous 
glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their 
seats. Ron and Hermione were hu
rrying toward Harry, passing  
 !#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +26" Scrimgeour going in the opposi
te direction. Harry turned and 
walked slowly on, waiting for them
 to catch up, which they finally 
did in the shade of a beech tree 
under which they had sat in hap-
pier times. 
ÒWhat did Scrimgeour want
?Ó Hermione whispered. 
ÒSame as he wanted at Christ
mas,Ó shrugged Harry. ÒWanted 
me to give him inside inform
ation on Dumbledore and be the 
MinistryÕs new poster boy.Ó 
Ron seemed to struggle with him
self for a moment, then he said 
loudly to Hermione, ÒLook, let me go back and hit Percy!Ó 
ÒNo,Ó she said firmly
, grabbing his arm. 
ÒItÕll make me
 feel better!Ó 
Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her 
smile faded as she looked up at the castle. 
ÒI canÕt bear the idea that we 
might never come back,Ó she said 
softly. ÒHow can Hogwarts close?Ó 
ÒMaybe it wonÕt,Ó said Ron. ÒWeÕ
re not in any more danger here 
than we are at home, are we? EverywhereÕs the same now. IÕd even 
say Hogwarts is safer, there are 
more wizards inside to defend the 
place. What dÕyou reckon, Harry?Ó ÒIÕm not coming back even if it does reopen,Ó said Harry. 
Ron gaped at him, but Hermione sa
id sadly, ÒI knew you were 
going to say that. But th
en what will you do?Ó 
ÒIÕm going back to the DursleysÕ once more, because Dumble-
dore wanted me to,Ó said Harry. ÒBut
 itÕll be a short visit, and then 
IÕll be gone for good.Ó 
ÒBut where will you go if you donÕt come back to school?Ó 
ÒI thought I might go back to
 GodricÕs Hollow,Ó Harry mut-
tered. He had had the idea in hi
s head ever since the night of 
&#'""-#)&'""&./0"
 +27" DumbledoreÕs death. ÒFor me, it started there, all of it. IÕve just got 
a feeling I need to go there. And I 
can visit my parentsÕ graves, IÕd 
like that.Ó 
ÒAnd then what?Ó said Ron. 
ÒThen IÕve got to track down the 
rest of the Horcruxes, havenÕt 
I?Ó said Harry, his eyes upon Du
mbledoreÕs white tomb, reflected 
in the water on the other side of 
the lake. ÒThatÕs what he wanted 
me to do, thatÕs why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was 
right Ñ and IÕm sure he was Ñ there are still four of them out 
there. IÕve got to find them and 
destroy them, and then IÕve got to 
go after the seventh bit of VoldemortÕ
s soul, the bit thatÕs still in his 
body, and IÕm the one whoÕs going to kill him. And if I meet 
Severus Snape along the way,Ó he 
added, Òso much the better for 
me, so much the worse for him.Ó 
There was a long silence. The cr
owd had almost dispersed now, 
the stragglers giving 
the monumental figure 
of Grawp a wide berth 
as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across 
the water. 
ÒWeÕll be there, Harry,Ó said Ron. 
ÒWhat?Ó 
ÒAt your aunt and uncleÕs house,
Ó said Ron. ÒAnd then weÕll go 
with you wherever youÕre going.Ó 
ÒNo ÑÓ said Harry quickly; he ha
d not counted on this, he had 
meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dan-
gerous journey alone. 
ÒYou said to us once before,Ó sa
id Hermione quietly, Òthat there 
was time to turn back if we wanted to. WeÕve had time, havenÕt 
we? ÒWeÕre with you whatever happens,Ó
 said Ron. ÒBut mate, youÕre 
!#$%&'(""&#)(&*"
 +28" going to have to come round my
 mum and dadÕs house before we 
do anything else, even
 GodricÕs Hollow.Ó 
ÒWhy?Ó 
ÒBill and FleurÕs we
dding, remember?Ó 
Harry looked at him, startled; the 
idea that anything as normal 
as a wedding could still exist seem
ed incredible and yet wonderful. 
ÒYeah, we shouldnÕt miss that,Ó he said finally. 
His hand closed automatically ar
ound the fake Horcrux, but in 
spite of everything, in spite of th
e dark and twisting path he saw 
stretching ahead for himself, in 
spite of the final meeting with 
Voldemort he knew must come, whet
her in a month, in a year, or 
in ten, he felt his heart lift at 
the thought that there was still one 
last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.

11/5/08   11:56:52 AMOh, the torment bred in the race, 
   the grinding scream of death 

    and the stroke that hits the vein, 

 the hemorrhage none can staunch, the grief, 

the curse no man can bear.
But there is a cure in the house, 
   and not outside it, no,

    not from others but from 
them, 
 their bloody strife. We sing to you, 
dark gods beneath the earth.
Now hear, you blissful powers underground — 
 answer the call, send help.

Bless the children, give them triumph now.
Aeschylus, 
 e Libation Bearers
Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live 

in one another still. For they must needs be present, that love 

and live in that which is omnipresent. In this divine glass, they 

see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pu
 is is 
the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet 

their friendship and society are, in the best sense, ever present, 

because immortal.
William Penn,

11/5/08   11:56:52 AM1The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in 
the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, 
wands directed at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other, 
they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking 

briskly in the same direction.
“News?” asked the taller of the two.

cloaks ﬂ

the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope

2wide driveway that led o
  the lane
 e high hedge curved with 
them, running o
  into the distance beyond the pair of impressive 
 wrought- iron gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke 
step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and 

passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.
 e yew hedges mu
  ed the sound of the men’s footst
 ere 
was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, 

pointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise 
proved to be nothing more than a  pure- white peacock, strutting 
majestically along the top of the hedge.
“He always did himself well, Lucius. 
Peacocks . . .
” Yaxley thrust 
his wand back under his cloak with a snort.
A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of 
the straight drive, lights glinting in the  diamond- paned downstairs 

windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a foun-

tain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and 
Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their 
approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.
 e hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, 
with a magniﬁ
 cent carpet covering most of the stone ﬂ
 oor. 
 e eyes 
of the  pale- faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley 

as they strode pa
 e two men halted at a heavy wooden door 
leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, 

then Snape turned the bronze handle.
 e drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and 
ornate table.
 e room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly 
up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring ﬁ
 re beneath 
a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. 
Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their

eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward 
to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious hu-

man ﬁ
 gure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as 
if suspended by an invisible rope, and reﬂ
 ected in the mirror and 
in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people 

seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a 

pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable 

to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.
“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. 
“You are very nearly late.”
 e speaker was seated directly in front of the ﬁ
 replace, so that 
it was di
  cult, at ﬁ
 rst, for the new arrivals to make out more than 
his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through 
the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming 

red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed 

to emit a pearly glow.
“Severus, here,” said Vol de mort, indicating the seat on his im-
mediate right. “Yaxley —beside Dolohov.”
 e two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around 
the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Vol de mort spoke 

ﬁ rst.“So?”

“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Pot-
ter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”
 e interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some sti
 ened, 
others ﬁ
 dgeted, all gazing at Snape and Vol de mort.
“Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Vol de mort. His red eyes fas-
tened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the 
watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would

4be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked 
calmly back into Vol de mort’s face and, after a moment or two, Vol-
de mort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.
“Good. Very good. And this information comes—”

“—from the source we discussed,” said Snape.

“My Lord.”

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Vol de-
mort and Snape. All faces turned to him.
“My Lord, I have heard di
 erently.”
Yaxley waited, but Vol de mort did not speak, so he went on, 
“Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the 

thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.”
Snape was smiling.
“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must 
be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. 
It would not be the ﬁ
 rst time; he is known to be susceptible.”
“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said 
Yaxley.
“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape. 
“I assure 
you,
 Yaxley, the Auror O
  ce will play no further part in 
the protection of Harry Potter
 e Order believes that we have 
inﬁ
 ltrated the Ministry.”
 e Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sit-
ting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was 

echoed here and there along the table.
Vol de mort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to 
the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in 
thought.

“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of 
Aurors will be used to transfer the boy—”
Vol de mort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at 
once, watching resentfully as Vol de mort turned back to Snape.
“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”
“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “
 e place, accord-
ing to the source, has been given every protection that the  Order 
and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little 
chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, 
the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us 

the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments 

to break through the rest.”
“Well, Yaxley?” Vol de mort called down the table, the ﬁ
 relight 
glinting strangely in his red eyes. “
Will 
the Ministry have fallen by 
next Saturday?”
Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.

“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have —with dif-
ﬁ culty, and after great e
 ort —succeeded in placing an Imperius 
Curse upon Pius
 icknesse.”
Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neigh-
bor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the 

back.
“It is a start,” said Vol de mort. “Bu
 icknesse is only one man. 
Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One 

failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”
“Yes —my Lord, that is true —but you know, as Head of the 
Department of Magical Law Enforcemen
 icknesse has regular 
contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads 
01_Dark Lord Ascending.indd   501_Dark Lord Ascending.indd   511/5/08   11:57:00 AM

6of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now 
that we have such a  high- ranking o
  cial under our control, to 
subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring 
Scrimgeour down.”
“As long as our frien
 icknesse is not discovered before he 
has converted the rest,” said Vol de mort. “At any rate, it remains 
unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we 

cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while 

he travels.”
“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed 
determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have 
several people planted within the Department of Magical Trans-
port. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know 

immediately.”
“He will not do either,” said Snape. “
 e Order is eschewing any 
form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; 

they mistrust everything to do with the place.”
“All the better,” said Vol de mort. “He will have to move in the 
open. Easier to take, by far.”
Again, Vol de mort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he 
went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person
 ere have been too 
many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them 
have been my own.
 at Potter lives is due more to my errors than 
to his triumphs.”
 e company around the table watched Vol de mort apprehen-
sively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might 

be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Vol de mort, how-

ever, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, 

still addressing the unconscious body above him.

“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and 
chance, those wreckers of all but the  best- laid plans. But I know bet-
ter now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. 
I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”
At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail 
sounded, a terrible,  drawn- out cry of misery and pain. Many of 
those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had 
seemed to issue from below their feet.
“Wormtail,” said Vol de mort, with no change in his quiet, 
thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving 
body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner 

quiet?”
“Yes,  m- my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, 
who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at 

ﬁ rst glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious 

gleam of silver.
“As I was saying,” continued Vol de mort, looking again at the 
tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, 

for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill 

Potter.”
 e faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have 
announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.
“No volunteers?” said Vol de mort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see no 
reason for you to have a wand anymore.”
Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy 
in the ﬁ
 relight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he 
spoke, his voice was hoarse.
“My Lord?”

8“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”
“I . . .”
Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight 
ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down 

her back, but beneath the table her slim ﬁ
 ngers closed brieﬂ
 y on his 
wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew 

a wand, and passed it along to Vol de mort, who held it up in front 

of his red eyes, examining it closely.
“What is it?”

“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.

“And the core?”

“Dragon —dragon heartstring.”

“Good,” said Vol de mort. He drew out his own wand and com-
pared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; 

for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Vol de-

mort’s wand in exchange for his own e gesture was not missed 

by Vol de mort, whose eyes widened maliciously.
“Give you my wand, Lucius? 
My 
wand?”
Some of the throng sniggered.
“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for 
you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than 

happy of late. . . . What is it about my presence in your home that 

displeases you, Lucius?”
“Nothing —nothing, my Lord!”

“Such 
lies,
 Lucius . . .”
 e soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had 
stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shud-
der as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard 
sliding across the ﬂ
 oor beneath the table.

 e huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Vol de mort’s chair. 
It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Vol de mort’s 
shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their 
vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Vol de mort stroked the creature 
absently with long thin ﬁ
 ngers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my re-
turn, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire 

for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he 
wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it —we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, sti
  nod, her eyes averted 
from Vol de mort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who 

had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at 

Vol de mort and away again, terriﬁ
 ed to make eye contact.
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice 
constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our 

family’s hous
 ere can be no higher pleasure.”
She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair 
and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where 
Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Vol de mort, 
for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.
“No higher pleasure,” repeated Vol de mort, his head tilted a little 
to one side as he considered Bellatrix. “
 at means a great deal, 
Bellatrix, from you.”
Her face ﬂ
 ooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of 
delight.
“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”
“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event 
that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?”

10She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.
“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”

“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and 
Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You 
must be so proud.”
 ere was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. 
Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped 
the table with their ﬁ
 sts. 
 e great snake, disliking the disturbance, 
opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did 

not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ hu-

miliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently ﬂ
 ushed with happiness, had 
turned an ugly, blotchy red.
“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring 
of mirth. “We 
—Narcissa and I 
—have never set eyes on our sister 
since she married the Mudbl is brat has nothing to do with 

either of us, nor any beast she marries.”
“What say you, Draco?” asked Vol de mort, and though his voice 
was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you 
babysit the cubs?”
 e hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, 
who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s 
eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her 
own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.
“Enough,” said Vol de mort, stroking the angry snake. 
“Enough.”
And the laughter died at once.
“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over 
time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.

“You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away 
those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”
“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears 
of gratitude again. “At the ﬁ
 rst chance!”
“You shall have it,” said Vol de mort. “And in your family, so in 
the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only 

those of the true blood remain. . . .”
Vol de mort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the 
slowly revolving ﬁ
 gure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny 
ﬂ ick. 
 e ﬁ
 gure came to life with a groan and began to struggle 
against invisible bonds.
“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Vol de mort.

Snape raised his eyes to the  upside- down face. All of the Death 
Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been 

given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the ﬁ
 re-
light, the woman said in a cracked and terriﬁ
 ed voice, “Severus! 
Help me!”
“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.

“And you, Draco?” asked Vol de mort, stroking the snake’s snout 
with his  wand- free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that 

the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore.
“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Vol de mort. “For 
those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity 
Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witch-

craft and Wizardry.”
 ere were small noises of comprehension around the table. A 
broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.
“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and

12wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so di
 erent from 
us...”
One of the Death Eaters spat on the ﬂ
 oor. Charity Burbage re-
volved to face Snape again.
“Severus . . . please . . . please . . .”
“Silence,” said Vol de mort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand, 
and Charity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting 
and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor 

Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the 
Daily 
Prophet.
 Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowl-
edge and magic.
 e dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor 
Burbage, a most desirable circumstance. . . . She would have us all 

mate with Muggles . . . or, no doubt, werewolves. . . .”
Nobody laughed this time
 ere was no mistaking the anger and 
contempt in Vol de mort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage 
revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her 
hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly 
away from him again.
“Avada Kedavra.”
 e ﬂ
 ash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. 
Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which 
trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their 
chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the ﬂ
 oor.
“Dinner, Nagini,” said Vol de mort softly, and the great snake 
swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.

14to think of it —particularly in light of his immediate plans —this 
seemed a serious ﬂ
 aw in his magical education. Making a mental 
note to ask Her mi one how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet 

paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to 

his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.
Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school 
trunk for the ﬁ
 rst time since he had packed it six years ago. At the 
start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed o
  the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated 

them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom —old quills, 
desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer ﬁ
 t. Minutes previ-
ously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a 

stabbing pain in the fourth ﬁ
 nger of his right hand, and withdrawn 
it to see a lot of blood.
He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside 
the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retriev-

ing an old badge that ﬂ
 ickered feebly between 
SUPPORT

DIGGORY
 and 
POTTER STINKS,
 a cracked and  worn- out Sneak-
oscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had 
been hidden, he ﬁ
 nally discovered the sharp edge that had done 
the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a  two- inch- long frag-

ment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had 

given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk 

for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift 

except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris 

like glittering grit.
Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had 
cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reﬂ
 ected 
back at him. en he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s

tacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.
It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the use-
less items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or 

not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch 

robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were 

piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and 

uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, proba-
bly, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle 
clothing, Invisibility Cloak,  potion- making kit, certain books, the 
photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and 
his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket 
were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B.

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBEREDby Elphias Doge
I met Albus Dum ble dore at the age of 

eleven, on our ﬁ
 rst day at Hogwarts. 
Our mutual attraction was undoubt-
edly due to the fact that we both felt 
ourselves to be outsiders. I had con-
tracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, 
and while I was no longer contagious, my pock-

marked visage and greenish hue did not encour-
age many to approach me. For his part,  Albus had 

 arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted 
notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, 
Percival, had been convicted of a savage and  well-

 publicized attack upon three young Muggles.
Albus never attempted to deny that his father 
(who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this 
crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage 

to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to 
be guilty. Beyond that, Dum ble dore refused to speak 
of the sad business, though many attempted to make 
him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise 
his father’s action and assumed that Albus too was a 

 Muggle- hater. 
 ey could not have been more mis-

17taken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he 
never revealed the remotest  anti- Muggle tendency. 
Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights 
gained him many enemies in subsequent years.
In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame 
had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of 
his ﬁ
 rst year he would never again be known as the 
son of a  Muggle- hater, but as nothing more or less 
than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. 
 ose of us who were privileged to be his friends ben-
eﬁ ted from his example, not to mention his help and 
encouragement, with which he was always generous. 

He confessed to me in later life that he knew even 

then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.
He not only won every prize of note that the school 
 ered, he was soon in regular correspondence with 
the most notable magical names of the day, including 
Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda 
Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waf-
ﬂ ing, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers 
found their way into learned publications such as
 Transﬁ
 guration Today, Challenges in Charming, 
and 
 e Practical Potioneer.
 Dum ble dore’s future career 
seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question 

that remained was when he would become Minister 
of Magic.
 ough it was often predicted in later years 
that he was on the point of taking the job, however, 

he never had Ministerial ambitions.

18Albus’s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school
 ey 
were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, 
unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by duel-
ing rather than through reasoned discussion. How-
ever, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that 
the brothers were not friend
 ey rubbed along 
as comfortably as two such di
 erent boys could do. 
In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that 

living in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an alto-
gether comfortable experience. Being continually 
outshone was an occupational hazard of being his 

friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable 

as a brother.
When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to 
take the  then- traditional tour of the world together, 

visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pur-

suing our separate careers. However, tragedy inter-

vened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother, 
Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole 
breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my depar-
ture long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s 
funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary 

journey. With a younger brother and sister to care 
for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer 
be any question of Albus accompanying me.
 at was the period of our lives when we had least 
contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insen-
sitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow es-
capes from chimaeras in Greece to the  experiments

19of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little 
of his  day- to- day life, which I guessed to be frustrat-
ingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in 
my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, 
toward the end of my year’s travels, that yet another 
tragedy had struck the Dum ble dores: the death of 

his sister, Ariana.
 ough Ariana had been in poor health for a long 
time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their 
mother, had a profound e
 ect on both of her broth-
ers. All those closest to Albus —and I count my-
self one of that lucky number 
—agree that Ariana’s 
death, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility 

for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their 

mark upon him forevermore.
I returned home to ﬁ
 nd a young man who had 
experienced a much older person’s su
 ering. Albus 
was more reserved than before, and much less light-
hearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana 
had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus 
and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time 
this would lift —in later years they reestablished, 

if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial 

one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of 

Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to 

mention them.
Other quills will describe the triumphs of the fol-
lowing years. Dum ble dore’s innumerable contribu-
tions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including

Dum ble dore and Grindelwald i
 ose who 
witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe 
they felt as they watched these two extraordinary 
wizards do battle. Dum ble dore’s triumph, and its 
consequences for the Wizarding world, are consid-
ered a turning point in magical history to match the 
introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy 

or the downfall of  He- Who- Must- Not- Be- Named.
Albus Dum ble dore was never proud or vain; he 
could ﬁ
 nd something to value in anyone, however 
apparently insigniﬁ
 cant or wretched, and I believe 
that his early losses endowed him with great human-
ity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more 
than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to 
the Wizarding world’
 at he was the most inspir-
ing and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters 

cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working 

always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as 
willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with 
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry ﬁ
 nished reading but continued to gaze at the picture ac-
companying the obituary. Dum ble dore was wearing his familiar,

21kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his  half- moon spec-
tacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of  X- raying Harry, 
whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dum ble dore quite well, but ever since 
reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had 
barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dum ble dore’s 
childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as 
Harry had known him, venerable and  silver- haired and ol
 e idea 
of a teenage Dum ble dore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a 
stupid Her mi one or a friendly  Blast- Ended Skrewt.
He had never thought to ask Dum ble dore about his past. No 
doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it 

had been common knowledge that Dum ble dore had taken part in 

that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought 

to ask Dum ble dore what that had been like, nor about any of his 

other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, 
Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and it seemed to 
Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and 

so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when 

he had failed to ask Dum ble dore more about himself, even though 

the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was 

also the only one he suspected that Dum ble dore had not answered 

honestly:
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”

“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the 
Prophet,
 folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the ﬁ
 rst volume of
 Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts.

face the room. It was much tidier
 e only things left out of place 
were today’s 
Daily Prophet,
 still lying on the bed, and on top of it, 
the piece of broken mirror.
Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment o
  today’s 
Prophet, 
and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the 
headline when he had taken the  rolled- up paper from the delivery 

owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said 

nothing about Vol de mort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was 

leaning on the 
Prophet
 to suppress news about Vol de mort. It was 
only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed.
Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was 
set over a picture of Dum ble dore striding along looking harried:
DUMBLEDORE ŠTHE TRUTH AT LAST?
Coming next week, the shocking story of the ﬂ
 awed 
genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard 

of his generation. Stripping away the popular image 
of serene,  silver- bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals 
the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the life-

long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dum ble dore 

carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be 

Minister of Magic content to remain a mere head-

master? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret 
organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? 
HOW did Dum ble dore really meet his end?

are explored in the explosive new biography,

was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman 
wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth 
bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling 

her ﬁ
 ngers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating im-
age, Harry read on.
In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and 
softer than her famously ferocious  quill- portraits 
might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her 

cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen 

for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes 

without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.
“Well, of course, Dum ble dore is a biographer’s 
dream,” says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure 
my book will be the ﬁ
 rst of very, very many.”
Skeeter was certainly quick o
  the mark. Her 
 nine- hundred- page book was completed a mere four 
weeks after Dum ble dore’s mysterious death in June. 
I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.
“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as 
I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I 
knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for 

the full story and I wanted to be the ﬁ
 rst to meet 
that need.”
I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks

24of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizen-
gamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dum ble-
dore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a 

Chocolate Frog card.”
Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.

“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him 
a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him. 

Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting 

at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me 

to watch out for trout.”
And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy 
have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter re-

ally feel that four short weeks have been enough to 
gain a full picture of Dum ble dore’s long and ex-
traordinary life?
“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me a
 ec-tionately across the knuckles, “you know as well as 

I do how much information can be generated by a 

fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ 

and a nice sharp  Quick- Quotes Quill! People were 
queuing to dish the dirt on Dum ble dore anyway. 
Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you 
know —he trod on an awful lot of important toes. 
But old Dodgy Doge can get o
  his high hippogri
 , because I’ve had access to a source most journal-
ists would swap their wands for, one who has never 
spoken in public before and who was close to Dum-
ble dore during the most turbulent and disturbing 

phase of his youth.”

  it, Betty, I’m not giving away all 
the highlights before anybody’s bought the book!” 
laughs Skeeter. “But I can promise that anybody 
who still thinks Dum ble dore was white as his beard 
is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody 
hearing him rage against  You- Know- Who would 
have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts 
himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent 

his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t ex-

actly  broad- minded when he was younger! Yes, Al-

bus Dum ble dore had an extremely murky past, not 

to mention that very ﬁ
 shy family, which he worked 
so hard to keep hushed up.”
I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dum ble dore’s 
brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizen-
gamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal 

ﬁ fteen years ago.
“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,” 
laughs Skeeter. “No, no, I’m talking about much 
worse than a brother with a fondness for ﬁ
 ddling 
about with goats, worse even than the  Muggle-
 maiming father 
—Dum ble dore couldn’t keep either 
of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by 

the Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the sister

26that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a 
positive nest of nastiness 
—but, as I say, you’ll have 
to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All 
I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dum ble dore never 
talked about how his nose got broken.”
Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter 
deny the brilliance that led to Dum ble dore’s many 

magical discoveries?
“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many 
now question whether he could really take full credit 
for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in 
chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had al-
ready discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when 

Dum ble dore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”
But the importance of some of Dum ble dore’s 
achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What 
of his famous defeat of Grindelwald?
“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” 
says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those 
who go  dewy- eyed over Dum ble dore’s spectacular 
victory must brace themselves for a bombshell —or 

perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. 

All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was 
the spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my 
book, people may be forced to conclude that Grin-

delwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from 

the end of his wand and came quietly!”
Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this 
intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the rela-
02_In Memoriam.indd   2602_In Memoriam.indd   2611/5/08   11:57:11 AM

27tionship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers 
more than any other.
“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote 
an entire chapter to the whole Potter–Dum ble dore 

relationship. It’s been called unhealthy, even sinis-

ter. Again, your readers will have to buy my book 
for the whole story, but there is no question that 
Dum ble dore took an unnatural interest in Potter 
from the word go. Whether that was really in the 

boy’s best interests —well, we’ll see. It’s certainly 

an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled 

adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry 
Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: 

a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclu-
sively of his conviction that  You- Know- Who had 
returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says 
Skeeter. “Poor Potter has few real friends, and we 

met at one of the most testing moments of his life 

—the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one 

of the only people alive who can say that they know 

the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still 
circulating about Dum ble dore’s ﬁ nal hours. Does 
Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dum ble-
dore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much —it’s all in 
the book 
—but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle

28saw Potter running away from the scene moments 
after Dum ble dore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Pot-
ter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man 
against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is every-

thing as it seems?
 at is for the Wizarding com-
munity to decide —once they’ve read my book.”
On that intriguing note, I take my leav
 ere 
can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant 
bestseller. Dum ble dore’s legions of admirers, mean-
while, may well be trembling at what is soon to 
emerge about their hero.
Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare 
blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he 

balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, 

where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overﬂ
 ow-
ing bin.
He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty draw-
ers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, 
barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from 
Rita’s article echoed in his head: 
An entire chapter to the whole  Potter–
 Dum ble dore relationship . . . It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister. . . . 
He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth . . . I’ve had access to 

a source most journalists would swap their wands for . . . 
“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the 
 next- door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, 
look up nervously.
Harry sat down hard on th
 e broken bit of mirror danced 
away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his ﬁ
 ngers,

Skeeter was defaming him. . . .
A ﬂ ash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut ﬁ
 nger slipping on 
the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must 
have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly 
peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing
 ere was nothing blue 
there for the mirror to reﬂ
 ect. He peered into the mirror fragment 
again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back 

at him.
He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, 
because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything 

was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dum ble dore 

would never pierce him again.

11/5/08   11:57:11 AM30The sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs 
and a voice yelled, “Oi! You!”
Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom 
his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. 
He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, 
he had thought he saw Dum ble dore’s eye. It was not until his uncle 

bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for 

the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the 

rucksack ﬁ
 lled with things he would be taking with him.
“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry ap-
peared at the top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”
Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. 
When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys
 ey 
were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn  zip- up jacket, 

Aunt Petunia in a neat  salmon- colored coat, and Dudley, Harry’s 

large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.

“Yes?” asked Harry.
“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. 
“Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word 
was sharp in his throat.
Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle 
began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following 

his movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple 

face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front 

of Harry and spoke.
“I’ve changed my mind,” he said.

“What a surprise,” said Harry.
“Don’t you take that tone—” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill 
voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down.
“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry 
with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re 
staying put, we’re not going anywhere.”
Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation 
and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every 
 twenty- four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking 

and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite 

moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dud-

ley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had 

been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and 

collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pac-
ing up and down the living room, “we —Petunia, Dudley, and I 

—are in danger. From —from—”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt

32in front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all 
over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.”
 e house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“ is house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead 
starting to pulse. “
Our
 house! House prices are skyrocketing around 
here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit 
of  hocus- pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your 
name and—”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this 
house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?”
“Don’t you dare —!” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon 
waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, 
as nothing to the danger he had spotted.
“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a 
house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? 

All the happy memories?”

uncle with this argument.
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that

“—Vol de mort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through 
this about a hundred times already.
 is isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dum-
ble dore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley—”
Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed 
that his uncle was attempting to ward o
  recollections of the unan-
nounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully 
grown wizard
 e arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt 
and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the

Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had 
once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not 
have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
“—Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry 
pressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm 
that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. 
 e Order is sure Vol de mort will target you, whether to torture you 
to try and ﬁ
 nd out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you 
hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”
Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that 
instant they were both wondering the same thing.
 en Uncle Ver-
non walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding 
and the Order wants to help. You’re being o
 ered serious protection, 
the best there is.”
Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. 
Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges
 e  next- door 
neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.
“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Durs-
ley abruptly.
 ere is,” said Harry, surprised.
“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as 
innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked 
man, we ought to qualify for government protection!”
Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical 
of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this 

world that he despised and mistrusted.
“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied. 
“We think the Ministry has been inﬁ
 ltrated.”

34Uncle Vernon strode to the ﬁ
 replace and back, breathing so heav-
ily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with 
concentration.
“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All 
right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. 

I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”
Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with di
  culty. 
 is ques-
tion had also been addressed half a dozen times.
“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, “Kingsley is 
protecting the Mug —I mean, your Prime Minister.”
“Exactly —he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the 
blank television screen
 e Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the 
news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as 
he visited a hospital
 is, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered 
the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reas-

suring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys 

to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with 
any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him 
with his earring in.
“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus 
Diggle are more than up to the job—”
“If we’d even seen CVs . . .” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost 
patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now point-

ing at the TV set himself.

—they’re caused by dementors, and

Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his par-
ents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and 
asked, “
 ere are . . . more of them?”
“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you 
mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by 
this time, seeing as they feed o
  fear and despair—”
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made 
your point—”
“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them—
Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi —which means dead 

bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard —will be able to ﬁ
 nd you and 
will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried 
to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you need help.”
 ere was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid 
smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through 
the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; 
Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But 
what about my work? What about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose 

those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards—”

He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened

room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus 
to cope with the Dursleys on their own.

had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping 

him a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!”

barrassed smile upon the  dark- haired Hestia. “It’s really good of 
you to do this. . . .

cousin. . . .”
“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus hap-
pily, striding into the living room
 e Dursleys did not look at all 
happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of 

mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch 

and wizard.

“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent!
 e plan, as Harry 
has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense 
pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be 
leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your 

house—Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry 

with an excuse to arrest him —we shall be driving, say, ten miles 

or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out 

for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle Vernon 

politely.
“Know how to —? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!” 
spluttered Uncle Vernon.
“Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be ut-
terly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus. 
He was clearly under the impression that he was ﬂ
 attering Vernon 
Dursley, who was visibly losing conﬁ
 dence in the plan with every 
word Dedalus spoke.
“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache 
rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia 
seemed to hear him.
“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard. 
 ere has been a little change in the arrangements—”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought  Mad- Eye was 
going to come and take me by  Side- Along-Apparition?”
“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely.  “Mad- Eye will explain.”

 e Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter 
incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, 

“Hurry up!” 
Harry looked all around the room before realizing that 

the voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.
“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said

coat. “We are attempting to time your departure from the house 

with your family’s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at 
the moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys. 
“Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”
None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, ap-
palled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.
“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured 
Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain 

in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, pos-

sibly tearful farewells.
 ere’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any 
further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,
“Well, this is  good- bye, then, boy.”
He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the 
last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his ﬁ
 st and 
began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.
“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp 
of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly 
ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.
“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.
He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mum-
bled, “I don’t understand.”
“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, look-
ing up at her son.
Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.

“Why isn’t he coming with us?”

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, star-
ing at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become 
a ballerina.
“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.

“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.

“Well, he —he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to 
glare at Harry and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?”
“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.

 ey heard the front door open, 
but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Pe-

tunia stopped too.
“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the 
doorway.
It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too di
  cult 
to put into words. After several moments of apparently painful in-

ternal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?”
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was 
clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the 
silence.
“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she 
asked, looking bewildered.
“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s
  with some 
of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard 

the man, we’re in a hurry.”
Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but 
Dudley did not follow.

40“O
  with some of 
our lot?”
Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before: 
Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives 
took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.
“It’s ﬁ
 ne,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”
“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. 
“Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? What danger 
you are in
 e unique position you hold in the hearts of the  anti-
 Vol de mort movement?”
“Er —no, they don’t,” said Harry. “
 ey think I’m a waste of 
space, actually, but I’m used to—”
“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”
If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have 
believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before 
accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for 
one thing, Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and 
astonished himself.
“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”

Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy 
for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.”
“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would 
have taken. . . .”
He looked curiously at his cousin
 ey had had virtually no con-
tact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet 

Drive so brieﬂ
 y and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on 
Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden 

that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although 

rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley ap-

peared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings.  After

opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into  scarlet-
 faced silence.
Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approv-
ing look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and 
embraced Dudley rather than Harry.
“S- so sweet, Dudders . . .” she sobbed into his massive chest. 
 “S- such a lovely  b- boy . . .  s- saying thank you . . .”
“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He 
only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”
“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’” said 
Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Pe-

tunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry 

from a burning building.
“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again 
at the living room door. “I thought we were on a tight schedule!”
“Yes —yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watch-
ing these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to

He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his 
own.
“—good luck. I hope we meet again.
 e hopes of the Wizard-
ing world rest upon your shoulders.”
“Oh,” said Harry, “righ
 anks.”
“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our 
thoughts go with you.”
“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt 
Petunia and Dudley.
“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle 
brightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.

42Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and 
walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him 
with magic.
 en Dudley held out his large, pink hand.
“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, 
“did the dementors blow a di
 erent personality into you?”
“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”
“Yeah . . .” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it. 
“Maybe. Take care, Big D.”
Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry 
heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door 

slammed.
Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, 
looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to 
ﬁ nd herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief 
into her pocket, she said, “Well — good- bye,” and marched toward 

the door without looking at him.
“Good- bye,” said Harry.
She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the 
strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: She 
gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge 

of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of 

the room after her husband and son.

window just in time to see the Dursleys’ car swinging 
out of the drive and o
  up the road. Dedalus’s top hat was visible 
between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backsea
 e car turned 
right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a 
moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.
Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, 
gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then 
made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he depos-
ited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stai
 e light 
was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. 
It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he 

was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he 
had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, 
the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak 

something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on

44Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and ﬂ
 icked through the 
channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to 
remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother 
whom he had lost.
“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hed-
wig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. “We’ll 
never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times? 
I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley puked 

on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out he was 

grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer, Dum ble-

dore walked through that front door. . . .”
Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig 
did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her 

head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.
“And under here, Hedwig” —Harry pulled open a door under 
the stairs —“is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then—

Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten. . . .”
Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, re-
membering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the 

underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned 

with a spider or two.
 ose had been the days before he had known 
anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his 
parents had died or why such strange things often happened around 
him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged 
him, even in those days: confused dreams involving ﬂ
 ashes of green 
light and once —Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when 

Harry had recounted it —a ﬂ
 ying motorbike . . .

Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head

Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, 
clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back 
garden.
 e darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering
 en, 
one by one, ﬁ
 gures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment 
Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet 
and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black 
sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting 
from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses.
Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. 
 ere was a general cry of greeting as Her mi one ﬂ
 ung her arms 
around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All 

righ’, Harry? Ready fer the o ?”
“Deﬁ nitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I 
wasn’t expecting this many of you!”
“Change of plan,” growled  Mad- Eye, who was holding two enor-
mous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from 
darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get 

undercover before we talk you through it.”
Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and 
chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s 
gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: 
Ron, long and lanky; Her mi one, her bushy hair tied back in a long 

plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and 

 long- haired; Mr. Weasley,  kind- faced, balding, his spectacles a little 
awry;  Mad- Eye,  battle- worn,  one- legged, his bright blue magical 
eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite 

shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and

46beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black, 
 broad- shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing 
hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mun-
dungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset 

hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and 

glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mund-

ungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.
“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime 
Minister?” he called across the room.
“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley. 
“You’re more important.”
“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the 
washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glit-

tered there.
“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.

“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”

 at’s brilliant, congrat—”
“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy  catch- up later!” 
roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. 
Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. “As Deda-
lus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius
 icknesse 
has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an impris-
onable o
 ense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a 
Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your 
protection, to prevent  You- Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely 
pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What 

he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.
“Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got 
the Trace on you.”

 e Trace, the Trace!” said  Mad- Eye impatiently. “

that detects magical activity around  under- seventeens, the way the 

Ministry ﬁ
 nds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around 
you, casts a spell to get you out of here
 icknesse is going to know 
about it, and so will the Death Eaters.
“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you 
turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. 
In short: Pius
 icknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and 
proper.”
Harry could not help but agree with the unknow
 icknesse.
“So what are we going to do?”

“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the 
only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells 
to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”
Harry could see ﬂ
 aws in this plan; however, he held his tongue 
to give  Mad- Eye the chance to address them.
“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: 
when you come of age, or” —Moody gestured around the pristine 

kitchen —“you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt 

and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full under-

standing that you’re never going to live together again, correct?”
Harry nodded.

“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the 
charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choos-
ing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for  You- Know-
 Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.
 e one thing we’ve got on our side is that  You- Know- Who 
doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail

 ey think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. 
However, this is  You- Know- Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just 
rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of 
Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, 
we’ve given a dozen di
 erent houses every protection we can throw 
at th
 ey all look like they could be the place we’re going to 
hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, 
Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s —you get the idea.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still 
spot a gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the 
boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, 
you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er —yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the 
twelve secure houses I’m heading for at ﬁ
 rst, but won’t it be sort of 
obvious once” —he performed a quick headcount —“fourteen of 
us ﬂ
 y o
  toward Tonks’s parents’?”
“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen 
of us won’t be ﬂ
 ying to Tonks’s parents’

Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a com-
panion, each pair heading for a di
 erent safe house.”
From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a ﬂ
 ask of what 
looked like mu
 ere was no need for him to say another word; 
Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.
“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No 
way!”
“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Her mi one with a hint 
of complacency.
“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives —!”

 erent, pretending to be me—”
“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly. 
“Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, 
scrawny gits forever.”
Harry did not smile.
“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you 
some hair.”
“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously 
there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you 

cooperate.”
“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use 
magic; we’ve got no chance,” said Fred.
“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”
“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his 
magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. 
“Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take 
the risk.”
Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved 
sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.
“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few 
of your hairs, boy, now.”
“But this is mad, there’s no need—”
“No need!” snarled Moody. “With  You- Know- Who out there 
and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have 

swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on

50to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only 
chance is to use decoys. Even  You- Know- Who can’t split himself 

into seven.”
Harry caught Her mi one’s eye and looked away at once.

“So, Potter —some of your hair, if you please.”

Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a  just- do- it sort 
of way.
“Now!” barked Moody.

With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of 
his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.
“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper 
out of the ﬂ
 ask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”
Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid
 e moment it 
made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, 
then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.
“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said 
Her mi one, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing 
slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean 
—Goyle’s potion 
looked like bogies.”
“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody.
Ron, Her mi one, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of 
Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.
“We’re one short,” said Lupin.
“Here,” said Hagrid gru
  y, and he lifted Mundungus by the 
scru
  of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrin-
kled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred 
and George instead.
“I’ve toldjer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus.
“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless

ter, not kill him. Dum ble dore always said  You- Know- Who would 

want to ﬁ
 nish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got 
the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.”
Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was 
already pulling half a dozen  eggcup- sized glasses from inside his 
cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice  Potion 
into each one.
“Altogether, then . . .”
Ron, Her mi one, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. 
All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats: 

At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. 

Her mi one and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and 

George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Her mi one’s and 

Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.
Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the 
large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up 
again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front 
of him.
Fred and George turned to each other and said together, “Wow 
—we’re identical!”
“I dunno, though, I think I’m still  better- looking,” said Fred, 
examining his reﬂ
 ection in the kettle.
“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, 
don’t look at me —I’m ’ideous.”
 ose whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said 
Moody, indicating the ﬁ
 rst sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget the 
glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, 
there’s luggage in the other sack.”

52 e real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre 
thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. 
He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pull-

ing out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stu
  ng their own things 
away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his 

privacy as they all began stripping o
  with impunity, clearly much 
more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been 

with their own.
“I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, looking 
down at his bare chest.
“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Her mi one, as she put 
on glasses.
Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each 
containing a stu
 ed snowy owl, from the second sack.
“Good,” said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and 
 luggage- laden Harrys faced him. “
 e pairs will be as follows: 
Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom—”
“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.

“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody, 
and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus 

as he continued, “Arthur and Fred—”
“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. “Can’t 
you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”
“Sorry, George—”

“I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really—”
“Enough messing around!” snarled Moody. “

George or Fred or whoever you are —you’re with Remus. Miss

53“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond 
of brooms.”
Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slav-
ish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on 
his face again.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral—”
Her mi one looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry 
knew that Her mi one too lacked conﬁ dence on a broomstick.
“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking 
over a mug tree as she waved at him.
Ron did not look quite as pleased as Her mi one.

“An’ you’re with me, Harry.

a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t 

take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, 

though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.”
 at’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.
“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” 
said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s 
had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never men-
tioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting 
they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick. 
All right then,” he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters’ 

clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, “I make it three 

minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back 

door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. 

. . . Come on. . . .”
Harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, Firebolt, and 
Hedwig’s cage before joining the others in the dark back garden.

54On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Her mi one had 
already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, 
Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the 
motorbike, goggles on.
“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”

 e very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’ the 
last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could ﬁ
 t yeh in one hand!”
Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into 
the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron 
smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper 

car. Harry st
 ed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet 
and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was extremely 
uncomfortable.
“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious 
to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, 

which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a 

few tricks up its handlebars now a’ one was my idea.”
He pointed a thick ﬁ nger at a purple button near the speed-
ometer.
“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing 
beside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure that was 
advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”
“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; I want 
us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the 

diversion’s lost.”
Everybody mounted their brooms.

“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a 
furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side 
04_The Seven Potters.indd   5404_The Seven Potters.indd   5411/5/08   11:57:31 AM

55of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a 
dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate.
“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody. “See you all in about 
an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One . . . two . . . 

THREE.”
 ere was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the 
sidecar give a nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his 

eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back o
  his face. Around him 
brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral 
ﬂ icked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and 
his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great 

was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of 

number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of 

the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and 

higher they climbed into the sky —
And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. 
At least thirty hooded ﬁ gures, suspended in midair, formed a 
vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, 
oblivious —
Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell 
and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they 

were: Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to 

the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his ruck-

sack slipped from beneath his knees —
“No —HEDWIG!”
 e broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize 
the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike 

swung the right way up again. A second’s relief, and then another

 oor of the

 e motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death 
Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.
“Hedwig —
Hedwig
—”But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the ﬂ
 oor of 
her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was 

paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people 
moving, ﬂ
 ares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring 
  into the distance, but he could not tell who they were —
“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled 
over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ram-

ming Hedwig’s cage onto the ﬂ
 oor, refusing to believe that she was 
dead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!”
“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and 
he opened the throttle.
“Stop —STOP!” Harry shouted, but as he looked back again 
two jets of green light ﬂ
 ew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had 
broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for 

Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were 

keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry 

had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around 

he cried, 
“Stupefy!”
 and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, 
cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scat-

tered to avoid it.
“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry 
looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick ﬁ
 nger into 
a green button near the fuel gauge.

57A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Cran-
ing his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair
 ree of the 
Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: 
He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind 
it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to 
save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness 
as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.
More Killing Curses ﬂ
 ew past Harry’s head from the two re-
maining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry 
responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in 
midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly 
of ﬁ
 reworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what 
was happening —
“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed 
at a second button
 is time a great net burst from the bike’s ex-
haust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they 
swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their 

unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the 

darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all 

shooting curses after it.
 is’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry 
saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the 
speedometer.
With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon ﬁ
 re burst from the 
exhaust,  white- hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a 

bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eat-

ers swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of ﬂ
 ame, and at the 
same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to 

the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.

58“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown ﬂ
 at onto his 
back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar 
was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.
“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside 
his jacket pocket he pulled his ﬂ owery pink umbrella.
“Hagrid! No! Let me!”
“REPARO!”

 ere was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the 
bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of 

the bike’s ﬂ
 ight, then the sidecar began to lose height —
In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, 
“Wingardium Leviosa!”
 e sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: 
He had but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses streaked 

past hi
 e three Death Eaters were closing in.
“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but 
Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as 

low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming ﬁ
 gures 
and yelled, 
“Impedimenta!”
 e jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment 
the man was absurdly  spread- eagled in midair as though he had hit 

an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him —
 en the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining 
Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below 
the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat —
“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!”

A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him 
out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him 
as he dragged himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself

59 back- to- back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the 
two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, 

pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, 
“Confringo!”
He knew a dreadful,  gut- wrenching pang for Hedwig as it ex-
ploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted o  his broom and fell 
from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta tried 
ter repair it meself —yeh’ve got no room—”
“It’s not a problem, just keep ﬂ
 ying!” Harry shouted back, as two 
more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.
As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, 
Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not 

dare use the  dragon- ﬁ
 re button again, with Harry seated so inse-
curely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their 

pursuers, barely holding them
 . He shot another blocking jinx 
at th
 e closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood 
slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw 

the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike —Stan —
“Expelliarmus!”
 Harry yelled.
 at’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”
 e hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the 
thunder of the motorbike’s engine: Next moment, both pursuers 
had fallen back and disappeared from view.
“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid. “Where’ve they 
gone?”
“I don’t know!”

But Harry was afraid
 e hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s 
the real one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the appar-

ently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?

60He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold 
of the back of Hagrid’s jacket.
“Hagrid, do the  dragon- ﬁ
 re thing again, let’s get out of here!”
“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”
 ere was a deafening, screeching roar again and the  white- blue 
ﬁ re shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward o
  what little of the seat he had, Hagrid ﬂ
 ung backward upon him, 
barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars —
“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!” yelled 
Hagrid.
But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked 
left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had 
they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . 
It’s him 
. . . it’s the real one. . . . 
 ey had said it right after he had tried to 
Disarm Stan. . . .
“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted 
Hagrid.
Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the 
ground still seemed remote as stars.
 en the scar on his forehead burned like ﬁ
 re; as a Death Eater 
appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry 
by millimeters, cast from behind —
And then Harry saw him. Vol de mort was ﬂ
 ying like smoke on 
the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-

like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white ﬁ
 ngers raising his 
wand again —
Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a 
vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells 

ﬂ ying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body ﬂ
 y past

61him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang 
and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the 
air, completely out of control —
Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which 
way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to 
die at any second. A hooded ﬁ
 gure on a broomstick was feet from 
him, he saw it raise its arm —
“NO!”

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself o
  the bike at the 
Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death 

Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the 

broomstick —
Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard 
Vol de mort scream, 
“Mine!”
It was over: He could not see or hear where Vol de mort was; he 
glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, 

“Avada—”
As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand 
acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some 
great magnet, saw a spurt of golden ﬁ
 re through his  half- closed 
eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury
 e remaining Death 
Eater yelled; Vol de mort screamed, 
“No!”
: Somehow, Harry found 
his nose an inch from the  dragon- ﬁ
 re button. He punched it with his 
 wand- free hand and the bike shot more ﬂ ames into the air, hurtling 

straight toward the ground.
“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. 
“Hagrid —
Accio Hagrid!
” e motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with 
the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing

62nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he 
could do about it. Behind him came another scream, 
“Your wand, 
Selwyn, give me your wand!”
He felt Vol de mort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared 
into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever 

saw: Vol de mort preparing to curse him once more —
And then Vol de mort vanished. Harry looked down and saw 
Hagrid  spread- eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard 
at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but 
with an earsplitting,  ground- trembling crash, he smashed into a 
muddy pond.
